<h2>Statement of Management Responsibility Including Internal Control over Financial Reporting</h2>
<p>Responsibility for the integrity and objectivity of the accompanying financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2019
and all information contained in these statements rests with the management of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial
Institutions (OSFI). These financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with Public Sector
Accounting Standards.</p>
<p>Some of the information in the financial statements is based on management’s best estimates and judgment, and gives due
consideration to materiality. To fulfill its accounting and reporting responsibilities, management maintains a set of accounts
that provides a centralized record of OSFI’s financial transactions.</p>
<p>Management is also responsible for maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial reporting designed to
provide reasonable assurance that financial information is reliable, that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are
properly authorized and recorded in accordance with the <em>Financial Administration Act</em> and other applicable legislation,
regulations, authorities and policies.</p>
<p>Management seeks to ensure the objectivity and integrity of data in its financial statements through careful selection,
training, and development of qualified staff; through an organizational structure that provides appropriate divisions of
responsibility; through communication programs aimed at ensuring that regulations, policies, standards, and managerial
authorities are understood throughout OSFI; and through conducting an annual assessment of the effectiveness of the system
of internal control over financial reporting.</p>
<p>The system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to mitigate risks to a reasonable level based on an ongoing
process to identify key risks, to assess effectiveness of associated key controls, and to make any necessary
adjustments.</p>
<p>Under the responsibility of the Chief Financial Officer, an assessment for the year ended March 31, 2019 was completed in
accordance with the Treasury Board <em>Policy on Financial Management</em> and the results and action plan are summarized in the
annex.</p>
<p>The effectiveness and adequacy of OSFI’s system of internal control is reviewed by the internal audit staff, who conduct
periodic risk based audits of different areas of OSFI’s operations, and by OSFI’s Audit Committee, which oversees
management’s responsibilities for maintaining adequate control systems and the quality of financial reporting, and which
reviews and provides advice to the Superintendent on the audited financial statements.</p>
<p>Deloitte LLP has audited the financial statements of OSFI and reports on their audit to the Minister of Finance. This report
does not include an audit opinion on the annual assessment of the effectiveness of OSFI’s internal controls over financial
reporting.</p>

<h3>NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h3>
<p>For the year ended March 31, 2019 (in thousands of Canadian dollars)</p>
<h3>1. AUTHORITY AND OBJECTIVES</h3>
	<p>The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) was established by the <em>Office of the Superintendent
	of Financial Institutions Act</em> (OSFI Act) in 1987. Pursuant to the <em>Financial Administration Act</em> (FAA), OSFI is a
	division of the Government of Canada for the purposes of that Act and is listed in schedule I.1 of the Act. The
	Government of Canada is OSFI’s parent and the ultimate controlling party of OSFI.</p>
	<p>OSFI’s mandate is:</p>
	<p><em><strong>Fostering sound risk management and governance practices</strong></em></p>
	<p>OSFI advances a regulatory framework designed to control and manage risk.</p>
	<p><em><strong>Supervision and early intervention</strong></em></p>
	<p>OSFI supervises federally regulated financial institutions and pension plans to determine whether they are in sound
	financial condition and meeting regulatory and supervisory requirements.</p>
	<p>OSFI promptly advises financial institutions and pension plans if there are material deficiencies, and takes corrective
	measures or requires that they be taken to expeditiously address the situation.</p>
	<p><em><strong>Environmental scanning linked to safety and soundness of financial institutions</strong></em></p>
	<p>OSFI monitors and evaluates system-wide or sectoral developments that may have a negative impact on the financial
	condition of federally regulated financial institutions.</p>
	<p><em><strong>Taking a balanced approach</strong></em></p>
	<p>OSFI acts to protect the rights and interests of depositors, policyholders, financial institution creditors and pension
	plan beneficiaries while having due regard for the need to allow financial institutions to compete effectively and take
	reasonable risks.</p>
	<p>OSFI recognizes that management, boards of directors and pension plan administrators are ultimately responsible for
	risk decisions and that financial institutions can fail and pension plans can experience financial difficulties resulting
	in the loss of benefits.</p>
	<p>In fulfilling its mandate, OSFI supports the government’s objective of contributing to public confidence in the
	Canadian financial system.</p>
	<p>The Office of the Chief Actuary provides a range of actuarial valuation and advisory services, under the <em>Canada
	Pension Plan Act</em> and the <em>Public Pensions Reporting Act</em> to the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and some federal
	government departments, including the provision of advice in the form of reports tabled in Parliament.</p>
	<p><strong>Revenue and spending authority</strong></p>
	<p>Pursuant to Section 17 of the OSFI Act, the Minister of Finance may spend any revenues collected under Sections 23
	and 23.1 of the OSFI Act to defray the expenses associated with the operation of OSFI. The Act also establishes a
	ceiling for expenses at $40 million above the amount of revenue collected to be drawn from the Consolidated
	Revenue Fund of Canada (CRF).</p>

	<p>OSFI’s revenues comprise assessments, service charges and fees. The expenses against which assessments may be
	charged include those in connection with the administration of the <em>Bank Act</em>, the <em>Cooperative Credit Associations
	Act</em>, the <em>Green Shield Canada Act</em>, the <em>Insurance Companies Act</em>, the <em>Protection of Residential Mortgage or
	Hypothecary Insurance Act</em> and the <em>Trust and Loan Companies Act</em>. The formula for the calculation of assessments
	is included in regulations.</p>
	<p>Subsections 23(1.1) and 23(5) of the OSFI Act provide that assessments may be charged for the administration of
	the <em>Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985</em> (PBSA, 1985) and the <em>Pooled Registered Pension Plans Act</em>. The
	assessments for the administration of pension plans subject to the PBSA are set annually in accordance with the
	<em>Assessment of Pension Plans Regulations</em>.</p>
	<p>Section 23.1 of the OSFI Act provides that the Superintendent may assess against a person a prescribed charge
	(service charge) and applicable disbursements for any service provided by or on behalf of the Superintendent for the
	person’s benefit or the benefit of a group of persons of which the person is a member. “Person” includes individuals,
	corporations, funds, unincorporated associations, Her Majesty in Right of Canada or of a province, and a foreign
	government. The service charges are detailed in the regulations.</p>
	<p>Pursuant to Section 16 of the OSFI Act, Parliament has provided annual appropriations to support the operations of
	the Office of the Chief Actuary (OCA).</p>
<h3>2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES</h3>
	<p>The financial statements of OSFI have been prepared in accordance with Canadian Public Sector Accounting
	Standards (PSAS) as issued by the Public Sector Accounting Board (PSAB). The accounting policies used in the
	financial statements are based on the PSAS applicable as at March 31, 2019. The policies set out below are
	consistently applied to all periods presented.</p>
	<p>The significant accounting policies of OSFI are set out below:</p>
<ul class="list-lower-alpha">
		<li><strong>Cash entitlement (Cash overdraft)</strong>
		<p>OSFI does not have its own bank account. The financial transactions of OSFI are processed through the CRF. Cash
		entitlement represents the maximum amount OSFI is entitled to withdraw from the CRF without further authority.</p>
			<p>OSFI has a statutory revolving expenditure authority pursuant to Section 17.4 of the OSFI Act. This authority
			enables OSFI to draw up to $40 million from the CRF to ensure availability of funds prior to receipt of revenue.
			Drawings on this facility are presented as cash overdraft.</p>
			<p>No interest is earned or charged on these amounts.</p>
		</li>
  <li><strong>Financial instruments</strong>
		<p>The classification of financial instruments at either fair value or amortized cost is determined by OSFI at initial
		recognition and depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired, or liabilities were incurred. All
		financial instruments are recognized initially at fair value. The fair value of financial instruments on initial
		recognition is based on the transaction price, which represents the fair value of the consideration given or received.
		Subsequent to initial recognition, financial instruments are measured based on the accounting treatment
		corresponding to their classification.</p>

	<td>Trade and other receivables and Accrued base assessments</td>
	<td><p>Trade and other receivables and Accrued base assessments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable 			payments that are not quoted in an active market.</p>
		<p>Subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, Trade and other receivables and Accrued base assessments are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less impairment, if any. Any gain, loss or interest income is recorded in revenue or expenses depending on the nature of the receivables that gave rise to the gain, loss or income.</p>

	<tr>
	<td>Financial liabilities</td>
	<td>Accrued salaries and benefits, Trade and other payables excluding employer’s contributions for employee benefit plans, Unearned base assessments, and Unearned pension plan assessments are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

	</tr>

</table>
  </li>
	<li><strong>Impairment of financial assets</strong>
		<p>OSFI assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that have occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (an incurred ‘loss event’) and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.</p>
		<p>For financial assets carried at amortized cost, OSFI first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists
		individually for financial assets that are individually significant, or collectively for financial assets that are not
		individually significant. If OSFI determines that there is objective evidence of impairment for an individual
		financial asset it must be assessed for impairment either individually, or in a group of financial assets with similar
		credit risk characteristics. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is,
		or continues to be, recognized are not included in a collective assessment of impairment. If there is objective
		evidence that an impairment loss has occurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the
		asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit losses
		that have not yet been incurred). The present value of the estimated future cash flows is discounted at the financial
		asset’s original effective interest rate. The impairment assessment must be based on the best estimates available in
		light of past events, current conditions, and taking into account all circumstances known at the date of the
		preparation of the financial statements. If a future write-off is later recovered, the recovery is credited to the
	  <em>Statement of Operations.</em></p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Tangible capital assets</strong>
		<p>Tangible capital assets are stated at historical cost, net of accumulated amortization and/or accumulated impairment
		losses, if any. Historical cost includes the costs of replacing parts of property and equipment when incurred, if the
		recognition criteria are met. Repair and maintenance costs are recognized in the <em>Statement of Operations</em> as
	  incurred.</p>
		<p>Amortization is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered" id="tbl-06">
			<tbody>
			<tr>
			  <th>Assets</th>
			  <th>Useful life</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>Leasehold improvements</td>
	
			<td>Lesser of useful life or remaining term of the lease</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>Furniture and fixtures</td>
	
			<td>7 years</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>Office equipment</td>
	
			<td>4 years</td>
			</tr>

			<td>3 to 5 years</td>

			<tr>

			<td>5 to 8 years</td>
			</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
	<p>Internally developed and externally purchased software are capitalized as tangible capital assets. Software acquired
		separately is measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of internally developed software consists of directly
		attributable costs necessary to create, produce, and prepare the software to be capable of operating in the manner
		intended by OSFI. Amortization of the assets begins when development is complete and the assets are available for
	  use. Costs incurred during the pre-development or post-implementation stages are expensed in the period incurred.</p>
	 
		<p>The assets’ residual values, useful lives and methods of amortization are reviewed at each financial year end and
	  adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Impairment of non-financial assets</strong>
	<p>OSFI assesses at each reporting date whether there are any internal indicators that an asset may be impaired (e.g.,
	damaged assets or assets no longer being used). If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an
	asset is required, OSFI estimates the asset’s recoverable amount.</p>
	<p>OSFI assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that an asset may be impaired. When a
	non-financial asset no longer contributes to OSFI’s ability to provide goods and services, or the value of future
	economic benefits associated with the non-financial asset is less than its net book value, the cost of the non-financial
	asset is reduced to reflect the decline in the asset’s value. Any writedowns are reflected in the <em>Statement of
	Operations</em> in the period the decline is recognized.</p>
	  <p>OSFI assesses internally developed software not yet in use for impairment on an annual basis.</p>
	</li>
	 <li><strong>Employee benefits</strong>
	  <p>Short-term benefits are recorded in the <em>Statement of Operations</em> when an employee has rendered the service. Unpaid
		short-term compensated leave that has vested at the reporting date is accrued at the reporting date and not
		discounted. OSFI contributes to the Government of Canada sponsored Public Service Health Care Plan and Dental
		Service Plan for employees. These contributions represent the total obligation of OSFI with respect to these plans.</p>
	  <p><em><strong>Pension benefits</strong></em></p>
	  <p>Substantially all of the employees of OSFI are covered by the public service pension plan (the Plan), a
		contributory defined benefit plan established through legislation and sponsored by the Government of Canada.
		Contributions are required by both the employees and OSFI to cover current service cost. Pursuant to legislation
		currently in place, OSFI has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions with respect to any
		past service or funding deficiencies of the Plan. Consequently, contributions are recognized as an expense in the
		year when employees have rendered service and represent the total pension obligation of OSFI.</p>
	  <p><em><strong>Severance</strong></em></p>
		 <p>On termination of employment, employees are entitled to certain benefits provided for under their conditions of
		employment through a severance benefits plan. The cost of these benefits is accrued as the employees render their
		services necessary to earn severance benefits. The severance benefits are based upon the final salary of the
		employee.</p>
		<p>The projected accrued benefit obligation is determined using an accrued benefit method which incorporates
		management’s best estimate of salary, retirement age and discount rate.</p>
	  <p><em><strong>Other benefits</strong></em></p>
	  <p>The Government of Canada sponsors a variety of other benefit plans from which former employees may benefit upon
		retirement. The Public Service Health Care Plan and the Pensioners’ Dental Service Plan are the two major plans
		available to OSFI retirees. These are defined benefit plans sponsored by the Government of Canada. Contributions
		are required by OSFI to cover current service cost. Pursuant to legislation currently in place, OSFI has no legal or
		constructive obligation to pay further contributions with respect to any past service or funding deficiencies of the
		Plan. Consequently, contributions are recognized as an expense in the year when employees have rendered service
		and represent the total obligation of OSFI with respect to these plans.</p>
	  <p><em><strong>Sick leave</strong></em></p>
	  <p>Employees are eligible to accumulate sick leave until retirement or termination. Unused sick leave is not eligible for
		payment on retirement or termination, nor can it be used as vacation. All sick leave is an accumulating non-vesting
		benefit. A liability is recorded for sick leave balances expected to be taken in excess of future allotments.</p>
	  <p>The cost of sick leave as well as the present value of the obligation is determined using an actuarial valuation.</p>
  </li>
	  <li><strong>Leases</strong>
	  <p>Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership related to the leased property are
		substantially retained by the lessor shall be accounted for as operating leases. OSFI records the costs associated
		with operating leases in the <em>Statement of Operations</em> in the period in which they are incurred. Any lease
		incentives received from the lessor are charged to the <em>Statement of Operations</em> on a straight-line basis over the
		period of the lease.</p>
	  <p>OSFI does not have borrowing authority and therefore cannot enter into lease agreements that are classified as leased
		tangible assets. OSFI has established procedures to review all lease agreements and identify if the proposed terms
		and conditions would result in a transfer to OSFI of substantially all the benefits and risks incidental to ownership.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>Statement of Operations</strong>
	  <p>The format of the <em>Statement of Operations</em> has been designed to show the revenues and expenses by each of OSFI’s
		business lines. It is considered that this format best represents the nature of the activities of OSFI. Expenses have
		been disclosed by nature in Note 7 of these financial statements.</p>
	  </li>
  <li><strong>Revenue recognition</strong>
	  <p>OSFI recognizes revenue so as to recover its expenses. Any amounts that have been billed for which costs have not
		been incurred are classified as unearned on the statement of financial position. Revenue is recorded in the
		accounting period in which it is earned (service provided) whether or not it has been billed or collected. At the end
		of the period, amounts may have been collected in advance of the incurrence of costs or provision of services, or
		alternatively, amounts may not have been collected and are owed to OSFI.</p>
	  <p><strong>Base assessments - </strong>Revenue from base assessments is recognized based on actual costs incurred as services are
		charged based on cost recovery and all costs are considered recoverable. Base assessments are billed annually based
		on an estimate of the current fiscal year’s operating costs (an interim assessment) together with a final accounting of
		the previous year’s assessment for actual costs incurred. Assessments are calculated prior to December 31 of each
		year, in accordance with Section 23(1) of the OSFI Act and the <em>Assessment of Financial Institutions Regulations</em>,
		2017. Differences between billed estimates and actual costs incurred at the end of the period are recorded as accrued
		base assessments or unearned base assessments.</p>
	  <p><strong>Pension plan assessments </strong>are earned from registered pension plans. Assessment rates are set annually by regulation
		based on budgeted expenses, pension plan membership and actual results from previous years. Pension plan
		assessments are charged in accordance with Section 23(1.1) and 23(5) of the OSFI Act. Revenue from pension plan
		assessments is recognized based on actual costs incurred as services are charged based on cost recovery and all costs
		are considered recoverable. Differences between the amounts billed to industry and actual costs incurred at the end
		of the period are recorded as accrued pension plan assessments or unearned pension plan assessments.</p>
	  <p><strong>User fees and charges </strong>include revenue earned pursuant to the <em>Charges for Services Provided by the Office of the
		Superintendent of Financial Institutions Regulations, 2002</em> – as amended from time to time – in respect of legislative
		approvals and approvals for supervisory purposes, and surcharges assessed to federally regulated financial
		institutions assigned a “stage” rating pursuant to the Guide to Intervention for Federal Financial Institutions.
		Assessment surcharges are charged in accordance with the <em>Assessment of Financial Institutions Regulations, 2017</em>.
		Revenue from user fees and charges is recognized by reference to the stage of completion of the service. Percentage
		of completion is measured based on actual services performed to date as a percentage of total services to be
		completed.</p>
	  <p><strong>Administrative monetary penalties </strong> are penalties levied to financial institutions when they contravene a provision of a
		financial institutions Act and are charged in accordance with the <em>Administrative Monetary Penalties (OSFI)
		Regulations</em>. Penalties levied are not available to reduce the net costs that OSFI assesses the industry (i.e., they are
		non-respendable) and are remitted to the CRF when collected. OSFI assesses its Administrative monetary penalties
		revenue against specific criteria in order to determine if it is acting as principal or agent. OSFI has concluded that it
		is acting as a principal for Administrative monetary penalty revenue.</p>
    <p><strong>Cost-recovered services </strong> represent revenue earned from sources other than those listed above. These services are
		provided in accordance with the terms and conditions agreed to by the transacting parties. Revenue from cost recovered
		services is recognized based on actual costs incurred, and all costs are considered recoverable.
		Revenue and the matching expenses from cost-recovered services not specifically related to the Regulation and
		supervision of federally regulated pension plans or Actuarial valuation and advisory services are grouped with
		the Regulation and supervision of federally regulated financial institutions on the <em>Statement of Operations</em>. This
		includes costs recovered from other government entities such as the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation
	for OSFI’s supervisory oversight in accordance with the <em>National Housing Act</em>.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>Government funding</strong>
	  <p>Government funding, including parliamentary appropriations, is recognized in the period that the appropriation was
		authorized, and any eligibility criteria met. Parliamentary appropriations for operating purposes are considered to be
		without stipulations restricting their use and are recognized as revenue when the appropriations are authorized.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>Contingent liabilities</strong>
	  <p>Contingent liabilities are potential liabilities, which may become liabilities when one or more future events occur or
	fail to occur. To the extent that the future event is likely to occur or fail to occur, and a reasonable estimate of the
	loss can be made, an estimated liability is accrued and an expense recorded. If the likelihood is not determinable or
	an amount cannot be reasonably estimated, the contingency is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>Budget figures</strong>
	  <p>The 2018-2019 budget is reflected in the <em>Statement of Operations and the Statement of Changes in Net Financial
		Assets</em> as approved by OSFI’s Executive Committee.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>Significant judgments, estimates and assumptions</strong>
	  <p>The preparation of OSFI’s financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions
		that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent
		liabilities at the reporting date. However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in
		outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability, in which case the impact
		will be recognized in the financial statements of a future fiscal period.</p>
	  <p>In the process of applying its accounting policies, management has made the following judgments that have the most
		significant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements:</p>
	    <ul>
		  	<li>Recognition of internally developed software;</li>
		  	<li>Lease classification;</li>
			<li>Administrative monetary penalties revenue – OSFI as principal;</li>
			<li>Estimated useful lives of tangible capital assets;</li>
			<li>Actuarial assumptions used to value sick leave and severance obligations;</li>
			<li>Likelihood of occurrence for contingent liabilities; and,</li>
		  <li>Estimates for the allowance for doubtful accounts.</li>
		  </ul>
	  </li>
	</ul>

	<p>The majority of OSFI’s revenue is comprised of assessments which are invoiced once a year, usually in the second
	quarter. As a result, trade receivable balances will vary significantly during the year and may also vary from year to
year depending on the timing of the invoicing.</p>
	<p>OSFI records an allowance for doubtful accounts considering the age of an outstanding receivable and the likelihood
	of its collection. An allowance for doubtful accounts is also made where collection of the receivable is doubtful
	based on information gathered through collection efforts. An allowance is reversed once collection of the debt is
	successful or the amount is written off. Impairment losses on trade and other receivables recognized during the year
	ended March 31, 2019 were $87 (March 31, 2018 - $115). Recoveries during the same period totaled $95 (March
31, 2018 - $81).</p>
	<p>A receivable will be considered to be impaired and written off when OSFI is certain that collection will not occur
	and all requirements of the OSFI Act or the <em>Debt Write-Off Regulations, 1994</em> have been met. A total of $11 was
	written off during the year ended March 31, 2019 (March 31, 2018 - $4). During the period, no interest was earned
	on impaired assets and none of the past due amounts were renegotiated. Those that are neither past due nor provided
for or impaired are considered to be fully collectible.</p>
	<p>The aging of trade receivables was as follows:</p>

	and no impairment was recognized. As at March 31, 2019, OSFI had $20,635 of tangible capital assets at cost that

<h3>6. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS</h3>
	<ul class="list-lower-alpha">
	<li><strong>Post-employment benefits</strong>
		<ul class="list-lower-roman">
		<li><em>Pension benefits</em>
		  <p>Substantially all of the employees of OSFI are covered by the public service pension plan (the Plan), a contributory
			defined benefit plan established through legislation and sponsored by the Government of Canada. Contributions are
			required by both the employees and OSFI. The President of the Treasury Board of Canada sets the required
			employer contributions based on a multiple of the employees’ required contribution. The general contribution rate
			effective as at March 31, 2019 was 10.427% (2018 - 9.905%). Total contributions of $10,777 (2018 - $9,268) were
		  recognized as expense in the year ended March 31, 2019.</p>
	
			<p>The Government of Canada holds a statutory obligation for the payment of benefits relating to the Plan. Pension
			benefits generally accrue up to a maximum period of 35 years at an annual rate of 2 percent of pensionable service
			times the average of the best five consecutive years of earnings. The benefits are coordinated with Canada/Québec
		  Pension Plan benefits and they are indexed to inflation.</p>
		</li>
		<li><em>Severance benefits</em>
			<p>OSFI used to administer a severance benefits plan for its employees. On termination of employment, eligible
			employees were entitled to certain benefits provided for under their conditions of employment based on their years
			of service. The plan was substantially curtailed in 2013 and employees no longer accumulate years of service.
			OSFI’s remaining liability in regards to this plan relates primarily to employees who chose to defer receipt of their
		  entitlement until departure. Current service benefits costs relate to the cost of involuntary departures.</p>
			<p>Information about OSFI’s severance benefit plan is presented in the table below.</p>

			<p>The most recent actuarial valuation for severance benefits was completed by an independent actuary as at March 31,
		  2019. OSFI measures its accrued benefit obligation for accounting purposes as at March 31 of each year.</p>
			<p>The significant actuarial assumption adopted in measuring OSFI’s accrued benefit obligation is a discount rate of
			1.75% (2018 - 2.12%). For measurement purposes, management’s best estimate for the general salary increases to
			estimate the current service cost and the accrued benefit obligation as at March 31, 2019 is an annual economic
			increase of 2.0% for the plan year 2020 (2018 - 1.0% for the plan year 2019). Thereafter, an annual economic
			increase of 1.5% is assumed (2018 - 1.0%). The average remaining service period of active employees covered by

          <p>The most recent actuarial valuation for sick leave benefits was completed by an independent actuary as at March 31,
		  2019. OSFI measures its accrued benefit obligation for accounting purposes as at March 31 of each year.</p>
		  <p>The significant actuarial assumption adopted in measuring OSFI’s accrued benefit obligation is a discount rate of
			1.80% (2018 - 2.16%). For measurement purposes, management’s best estimate for the general salary increases to
			estimate the current service cost and the accrued benefit obligation as at March 31, 2019 is an annual economic
			increase of 2.0% for the plan year 2020 (2018 - 1.0% for the plan year 2019). Thereafter, an annual economic
			increase of 1.5% is assumed (2018 - 1.0%). The average remaining service period of active employees covered by
		  the benefit plan is 14 years (2018 - 14 years).</p>

<h3>8. ADMINISTRATIVE MONETARY PENALTIES</h3>
	<p>Administrative monetary penalties levied by OSFI are remitted to the CRF. The funds are not available for use by
	OSFI and are not included in the balance of the Cash entitlement. As a result, the penalties do not reduce the amount
	that OSFI assesses the industry in respect of its operating costs. Refer to Note 2 i) for further information on OSFI’s
accounting policy as it relates to administrative monetary penalty revenue.</p>
	<p>In the year ended March 31, 2019, OSFI levied $21 (2018 - $121) in administrative monetary penalties.</p>

<h3>9. OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS</h3>
<p>OSFI has entered into operating lease agreements for office space and office equipment in four locations across
Canada. The minimum aggregate annual payments for future fiscal years are as follows:</p>

<h3>10. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT</h3>
	<p>OSFI’s financial liabilities include Accrued salaries and benefits, Trade and other payables, Unearned base
	assessments and Unearned pension plan assessments. The main purpose of these liabilities is to provide short-term
	financing for OSFI’s operations. Financial assets include Cash entitlement, Trade and other receivables, and Accrued
base assessments.</p>
	
	<p>OSFI is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk in connection with its financial instruments. OSFI’s risk
	exposures and its processes to manage these risks did not change significantly during the year ended March 31,
2019.</p>
	<ul class="list-lower-alpha">
	<li><strong>Market risk</strong>
	  <p>Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
		changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price
		risk, such as equity risk. OSFI is exposed to currency risk on any amounts payable that are to be settled in a currency
	  other than the Canadian dollar but is not exposed to interest rate risk nor to other price risk.</p>
		<p>Currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
		changes in foreign exchange rates. OSFI’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily
	  to OSFI’s operating activities (when expenses are denominated in a currency other than the Canadian dollar).</p>
		<p>OSFI manages its exposure to currency risk by structuring its contracts in Canadian dollars wherever possible. The
		majority of OSFI’s transactions presented were denominated in Canadian dollars; as such, OSFI’s exposure to
	  currency risk for all periods presented is insignificant.</p>
		<p>There is no impact to revenues since all billings are in Canadian dollars.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Credit risk</strong>
	  <p>Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument, resulting in a
		financial loss. The maximum exposure OSFI has to credit risk as at March 31, 2019 is $9,101
		(March 31, 2018 - $8,086) which is equal to the carrying value of its Trade and other receivables and Accrued base
	  assessments.</p>
		<p>All federally regulated financial institutions and federally regulated private pension plans are required to register
		with OSFI and pay the assessments as established by OSFI. Any loss incurred by OSFI as a result of a counterparty
		not meeting its obligations is recorded in the year incurred and collected in the following year through assessments to
		the industry to which the balance pertains, as outlined in the OSFI Act. All remaining receivables are with other
		Canadian federal and provincial government organizations, where there is minimal potential risk of loss. OSFI does
	  not hold collateral as security.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Liquidity risk</strong>
	  <p>Liquidity risk is the risk that OSFI will encounter difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with current and
		future financial liabilities. OSFI’s objective is to maintain sufficient Cash entitlement through its collection of base
		assessments, cost-recovered services and other fees and charges in order to meet its operating requirements. OSFI
		manages liquidity risk through detailed annual planning and billing processes that are structured to allow for
		sufficient liquidity from one billing period to the next. OSFI’s objective is to accurately estimate its operating costs
		and cash requirements for the current year and to recover these through its interim base assessments, fees and other
	  sources of revenue.</p>
		<p>OSFI’s policy is to satisfy liabilities by the following means (in decreasing order of priority):</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Disbursing payments from its Cash entitlement account; and,</li>
			<li>Drawing on its revolving expenditure authority, pursuant to Section 17.4 of the OSFI Act.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Drawings on this facility were $Nil as at March 31, 2019 (2018 - $Nil).</p>
		<p>Refer to Note 1 for further information on OSFI’s authority and Note 2 a) for further information on the accounting
	  policies for its revolving spending authority.</p>
	</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The table below summarizes the maturity profile of OSFI’s financial liabilities as at March 31, 2019 and March 31,
		2018 based on contractual undiscounted payments. When the counterparty has a choice of when the amount is paid,
		the liability is allocated to the earliest period in which OSFI can be required to pay. When amounts are due in
installments, each installment is allocated to the earliest period in which OSFI can be required to pay.</p>

	<p>OSFI was established on July 2, 1987 by the OSFI Act. OSFI was created through the merger of its two predecessor
agencies – the Department of Insurance and the Office of the Inspector General of Banks. To help fund OSFI’s first
year of operations and establish a pool of working capital necessary to support its annual assessment and expenditure
cycle, OSFI was credited with the assessments that recovered the costs of its predecessors for the previous fiscal
year. This amount is reflected as contributed surplus.</p>
	<p>The accumulated deficit was created as part of OSFI’s transition to accrual accounting under Canadian Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in fiscal 2000-2001. The transition to GAAP accounts for $789 of the
balance. On April 1, 2010, OSFI transitioned to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) from GAAP
which increased the accumulated deficit by $2,170. The balance as at March 31, 2011 increased by an additional
$380 as a result of the operations for the year ended March 31, 2011 as determined under IFRS. On April 1, 2017,
OSFI ceased to report in accordance with IFRS and adopted PSAS. These new standards were adopted with
retrospective restatement, and therefore the 2017 comparative figures were restated. The balance at March 31, 2017
decreased by $692 as a result of the restatement of operations for the year ended March 31, 2017, leaving a balance
of $2,647 as at March 31, 2019.</p>

<h2>Annex to the Statement of Management Responsibility including Internal Control over Financial Reporting</h2>
<h2>(Unaudited)</h2>
<h2>Fiscal Year 2018-2019</h2>
<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
<p>This document provides summary information on the measures taken by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) including information on internal control management, assessment results and related action plans.</p>
<p>Detailed information on OSFI’s authority, mandate and program activities are available in the <a href="/Eng/osfi-bsif/rep-rap/dpr-rmr/Pages/default.aspx"><em>Departmental Results Report</em></a> and the <a href="/Eng/osfi-bsif/rep-rap/rpp/Pages/default.aspx"><em>Departmental Plan</em></a>.</p>
<h3>2. Departmental system of internal control over financial reporting</h3>
<h4>2.1 Internal Control Management</h4>
<p>OSFI has a well-established governance and accountability structure to support the assessment efforts and oversight of its system of internal control. An internal control management framework, approved by the Superintendent, is in place that includes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Organizational accountability structures as they relate to internal control management to support sound financial management, including roles and responsibilities for senior managers in their areas of responsibility;</li>
	<li>Values and ethics;</li>
	<li>On-going communication and training on statutory requirements, policies and procedures for sound financial management and control; and,</li>
	<li>Monitoring and regular updates on internal control management, as well as the provision of related assessment results and action plans to the Operating Committee and the Audit Committee.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Audit Committee provides advice to the Superintendent on the adequacy and functioning of the agency’s risk management, control and governance frameworks and processes.</p>
<h4>2.2 Service Arrangements Relevant to Financial Statements</h4>
<h5>2.2.1 Reliance on other federal government organizations</h5>
<p>OSFI relies on other organizations for the processing of certain transactions that are recorded in its financial statements. Information concerning the ICFR of other organizations that OSFI relies on can be found on their respective websites.</p>
<p><strong>Common Arrangements</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) centrally administers the payments of salaries, the shared travel system (STS) and the procurement of certain types of goods and services falling outside OSFI’s contracting delegation of authority.</li>
	<li>Shared Services Canada (SSC) administers the procurement of certain goods related to information management and information technology falling outside OSFI’s contracting delegation of authority.</li>
	<li>The Department of Justice provides legal services to OSFI.</li>
	<li>Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) provides OSFI with information used to calculate various accruals, such as employee benefits rate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Specific Arrangements</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>TBS provides OSFI with corporate financial systems and system support.  The services relate to the support of the SAP financial system platform for capturing all financial transactions and the Cognos Business Intelligence Tool for reporting. As the service provider, TBS is responsible for ensuring that IT–general controls over the SAP environment are designed and operating effectively. As the client, OSFI retains responsibility over certain IT–general controls over the SAP environment, such as user access controls and segregation of duties.</li>
</ul>
<h5>2.2.2 Services that other organizations rely upon</h5>
<p><strong>Specific Arrangements</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>OSFI provides financial services for the calculation of assessments revenue and actuarial services to the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC).</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. OSFI’s assessment results during fiscal year 2018-2019</h3>
<p>During fall 2018, OSFI updated its <em>Five-Year Risk Based Plan for the Assessment, Remediation and Ongoing Monitoring of Internal Controls over Financial Reporting</em>. The plan covers the five-year period from April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2024.</p>
<p>The key findings and significant adjustments required from the current year’s assessment activities are summarized below.</p>
<p><strong>New or significantly amended key controls</strong> – In the current year, there were no significantly amended key controls in existing processes that required a reassessment. There were only minor changes to the design process for five of OSFI’s key business processes.</p>
<p><strong>On-going monitoring program</strong> – As part of its rotational ongoing monitoring plan, OSFI completed its assessment of financial controls within the following eight key business processes: Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Procurement &amp; Contracting, Month-end/Year-end accruals, Payroll, Quarter-end/Year-end disclosures, Revenue – Base Assessments and Revenue – Pension Plan Assessments. Key controls were reviewed, tested, and found to be operating effectively as designed, with remedial actions required in two processes. </p>
<p>An assessment of the design effectiveness of entity level controls (ELCs) was completed during the fiscal year. Consistent with the five-year risk based monitoring plan in effect, OSFI also completed its operating effectiveness testing of ELCs. Overall, they were found to be adequately designed and operating effectively.</p>
<p>IT General Controls (ITGCs) over the SAP financial system are shared between OSFI and TBS. OSFI completed the operating effectiveness assessment of controls under its responsibility while TBS completed a <em>Reporting on Controls at a Service Organization</em> (commonly called the Canadian Standard on Assurance Engagements (CSAE) 3416) audit over the design and operating effectiveness of the SAP system, which benefits all members of the cluster. TBS reports on the findings of this audit in its Annex to the <em>Statement of Management Responsibility including Internal Control over Financial Reporting</em>.</p>
<h3>4. OSFI’s action plan</h3>
<h4>4.1 Progress during the fiscal year 2018-2019</h4>
<p>OSFI conducted its on-going monitoring of ICFR according to its <em>Five-Year Risk Based Plan for the Assessment, Remediation and Ongoing Monitoring of Internal Controls over Financial Reporting</em> as follows:</p>
