      </div>
      <p>The deposit-taking industry in Canada comprises six large domestic banks designated as domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs) and many smaller deposit-taking institutions. (Royal Bank of Canada was also designated a global systemically important bank by the <a href="https://www.fsb.org/" rel="external">Financial Stability Board</a> in November 2017.)</p>
      <p>Through the year, OSFI closely monitored economic, financial and other risks facing deposit-taking institutions, including system-wide or sector developments that could have a negative impact on their financial condition. A key focus has been addressing risks and vulnerabilities related to mortgage lending, which continues to be elevated given low lending rates and significant increases in household debt, particularly mortgage debt. Should an economic downturn lead to a meaningful fall in housing prices, there is a risk that lenders could face material credit losses.</p>
      <p>Other key areas of supervisory focus included cyber security risks, implementation of revised corporate governance guidance and liquidity risks.</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12" style="padding-left: 0; padding-right: 0;">
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>The six largest banks account for about 90 percent of total assets held by federally regulated deposit-taking institutions. Their diversified business lines extend beyond traditional deposit-taking and lending activities to trading, investment banking, wealth management and insurance. In addition to their primary domestic focus, these large banks operate in many other countries.</p>
            <p>The remaining 10 percent of assets are held by small and medium-sized institutions with various market and business strategies such as mortgage lending, commercial real estate lending and credit card lending.</p>
          </div>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Canadian banks reported capital ratios well above the minimum common equity tier 1 (CET1) requirements during 2018-19. The D-SIBs remained above the eight percent Pillar 1 capital requirement, reflecting a minimum seven percent plus a one percent D-SIB capital surcharge. The D-SIBs remained above the capital requirement of 9.75 percent. Small and medium-sized banks also reported capital ratios above the minimum level of seven percent.</p>
      <p>Overall, income remained stable or grew at deposit-taking institutions. Return on equity for the industry was about 15.2 percent at the end of the 2018 fiscal year, primarily due to solid net income generation and a mainly favourable credit environment.</p>
      <p>The top risks facing small and medium-sized banks (SMSB) include funding, housing market and consumer indebtedness, cyber security and commercial real estate lending. Mitigating actions taken by OSFI include: monitoring market and strategic factors which may reduce SMSB access to broker deposit channels; identifying financial institutions most vulnerable to a downturn in real estate secured lending based on reputational, liquidity and regulatory compliance factors; and strengthening cyber security event reporting protocols and reviewing cyber risks raised through third-party services.</p>

      <h2>Insurance Supervision</h2>
      <h3>Life Insurance </h3>
      <p>The life insurance industry in Canada comprises three large institutions and more than 70 domestic companies and foreign branches. The large insurers account for more than 90 percent of the assets, and have operations in Canada, the U.S., Europe and Asia. They offer a broad range of wealth management, life and health insurance products through a number of distribution channels. The smaller insurers are more restricted in product breadth and distribution.</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <figure class="grph_border mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md"> <img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="/Documents/WET5/AR/img/Large-insurers_eng.svg" /> </figure>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>In 2018, the life insurance industry began measuring capital based on the <a href="/Eng/fi-if/rg-ro/gdn-ort/gl-ld/Pages/LAR19_index.aspx">Life Insurance Capital Adequacy Test (LICAT) guideline</a>, which replaced the Minimum Continuing Capital and Surplus Requirement(MCCSR) guideline as the key metric used to assess capital adequacy. The LICAT improves the overall measurement of the quality of available capital and incorporates refined risk measurement techniques. Overall, the industry's transition to this new capital metric has been smooth.</p>
      <p>During the last several years, there has been strong growth in the equity markets with increases in interest rates in the U.S. and Canada. While this has alleviated the pressure on insurers with long-term liabilities, it is unlikely rates will rise to pre-2008 levels in the near future. OSFI has observed a small increase in insurers' investment risk profiles as they seek higher yield. Moreover, a number of macroeconomic and geopolitical issues have contributed to recent increases in market volatility that will further challenge the industry.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.iasplus.com/en/resources/ifrsf/iasb-ifrs-ic/iasb" rel="external">International Accounting Standards Board</a> (IASB) has proposed deferring the effective date of <a href="https://www.ifrs.org/projects/2017/insurance-contracts/" rel="external">International Financial Reporting Standard 17 <em>Insurance Contracts</em> (IFRS17)</a> by one year to January 1, 2022. Nonetheless, a large amount of work remains for the insurance industry to accommodate the significant changes to systems, operations, capital requirements and financial reporting. OSFI requires insurers to provide semi-annual progress reports outlining their project plans and readiness to implement this new standard. The LICAT, which was developed in anticipation of the potential effects of IFRS 17, will require some modifications. OSFI consulted with industry and conducted a quantitative impact study.</p>
      <p>The digitization of financial services is creating new competitive challenges for insurers that are accompanied by increased operational risk, including information risk management exposure and cyber security. Addressing these challenges requires expertise and financial resources that may be beyond some insurers' financial capabilities. OSFI will be monitoring developments at insurers as technology evolves as well as collaborating with other regulators.</p>
      <p>The 2018 aggregate capital ratio for the industry (first year of reporting under LICAT) was 138 percent. The aggregate level of capital has been well above OSFI's minimum requirements for the last several years as companies built up capital in response to market volatility.</p>
      <p>Return on equity was 10 percent compared to 8.4 percent in 2017. Net income for 2018 was $11.7 billion, an increase of $2.7 billion from the prior year. One-time charges, including the impact of U.S. tax changes, affected earnings in 2017. About 90 percent of net income is attributable to the three large insurers.</p>
      <p>Challenges remain as persistently low interest rates make asset/liability management more difficult and put a strain on in-force product profitability given that many products cannot be re-priced due to contractual provisions. OSFI is monitoring changes in risk policies to ensure companies adopt appropriate mitigation practices and controls.</p>

      <h3>Property and Casualty Insurance</h3>
      <p>The property and casualty (P&amp;C) industry reported lower net income in 2018 due to declines in underwriting and investment income. Catastrophes and weather-related losses continue to drive earnings volatility. The significant Ontario/Quebec windstorm and a series of smaller weather-related catastrophes affected profitability in 2018.</p>

            <p class="graph__caption-text"> A key measure of core profitability is the combined ratio, which measures revenue from premiums relative to the sum of claims and expenses. A combined ratio under 100 percent reflects an underwriting profit as premium income exceeds claims and expenses. The aggregated combined ratio deteriorated to 100 percent in 2018 from 98 percent in the previous year. It is expected the trend will continue as weather-related claims require greater time for adjudication.</p>

      <p>The <a href="/Eng/fi-if/rg-ro/gdn-ort/gl-ld/Pages/mct2019.aspx">Minimum Capital Test (MCT)</a> is the capital metric for Canadian P&amp;C insurers while the Branch Adequacy of Assets Test (BAAT) is the metric for foreign-owned branch operations in Canada. The industry remains well-capitalized, with a capital ratio of 259 percent in 2018, above the supervisory target of 150 percent.</p>
      <p>A comprehensive review of reinsurance practices has been a key initiative over the past two years. While reinsurance is an important risk management tool, certain observed industry business models rely too heavily on it and this can result in concentrated counterparty credit risk. Institutions must have adequate financial resources and proper risk management practices in place. OSFI released a <a href="/Eng/fi-if/rg-ro/gdn-ort/gl-ld/Pages/b3-dft.aspx">discussion paper</a> in June 2018 outlining a number of proposed changes to the reinsurance framework and conducted a quantitative impact study in early 2019 on a key proposed restriction. Further related public consultation on proposed guideline changes are planned for the latter part of 2019-20.</p>
      <p> During 2018-19, OSFI continued to actively assess the accounting and capital implications of the new IFRS 17 as well as monitored insurer progress towards implementation of this new accounting standard.</p>

      <p>The mortgage insurance industry in Canada comprises three participants: two private sector insurers regulated by OSFI and the <a href="https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/" rel="external">Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC)</a>, which is a Crown corporation also subject to OSFI oversight.</p>
      <p>At the end of 2018, the average <a href="/Eng/fi-if/rg-ro/gdn-ort/gl-ld/Pages/micat.aspx">Mortgage Insurance Capital Adequacy Test (MICAT)</a> ratio of the private sector mortgage insurers stood at 170 percent and CMHC's MICAT ratio was 172 percent (including transitional arrangements under the new framework). Capital ratios for each of the mortgage insurers remained above their defined operating and internal target levels as well as the minimum supervisory requirement of 150 percent.</p>
      <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12 col-lg-4 img--right">

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Mortgage insurers achieved favourable financial performance during 2018 despite increased claims expenses and lower net investment income. Total after-tax net income declined by 21 percent from the previous year to $1.6 billion, while their weighted-average return on equity declined to 8.7 percent from 9.5 percent. This was driven by the decline in the total volume of new business written by 56 percent for portfolio insurance, reflecting trends in real estate sales volumes and reduced lender demand for portfolio coverage. Total insurance in-force declined by six percent to $724 billion (not including CMHC's securitization guarantees.)</p>
      <p>Despite continuing favourable financial results and reduced new business volumes, the mortgage insurers remain vulnerable to rising consumer debt levels and the risk of a housing price correction in certain markets. In the event of a significant and sustained increase in mortgage borrowing rates or a significant increase in the unemployment rate, borrowers' repayment capacity may become stretched, potentially elevating the vulnerability of the mortgage insurers to higher claims. Over time, the borrower stress test will help to mitigate this risk.</p>
      <p>Planned supervisory activities for the coming year will focus on reviews of the private sector mortgage insurers' compliance with the <em>Protection of Residential Mortgage or Hypothecary Insurance Act (PRMHIA</em>) and economic capital modeling practices. Standardized stress tests will also be updated to support ongoing assessment the mortgage insurers' loss-absorbing capacity under severe economic stress scenarios. </p>
      <h2>Supervisory Tools</h2>
      <h3>Managing Risk Effectively</h3>
      <div class="col-md-4 img--left"> <img src="/Documents/WET5/AR/img/Framework-Cover_eng.png" alt="" class="img-responsive"> </div>
      <p>OSFI maintains internal assessment guidance to support its risk-based <a href="/osfi/index_e.aspx?ArticleID=117">Supervisory Framework</a>,which considers an institution's inherent business risks, risk management practices (including corporate governance) and financial condition.</p>
      <p>Risk management seminars are held annually for regulated industries (deposit-taking, life and P&amp;C insurance and mortgage insurance) to reinforce OSFI's expectations in key risk management areas. These seminars are also an opportunity to share lessons learned and information on issues being discussed internationally by peer regulators.</p>
      <p>College of Supervisors bring together executives from Canadian banks or insurers with supervisors from applicable host-country jurisdictions where these institutions do business. In 2018-19, OSFI hosted colleges for two large bank and one large life insurer.</p>
      <p>Crisis Management Groups are held annually with the big six banks in conjunction with the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation to assess how prepared D-SIBs are in the event of trouble or failure. These sessions help identify weaknesses in the banks' recovery and resolution frameworks. </p>
      <h3>Composite Risk Ratings</h3>
      <div class="col-md-4 col-lg-4 col-sm-12 img--right">

      </div>
      <p>The <a href="/Eng/fi-if/rai-eri/sp-ps/Pages/crr.aspx">Composite Risk Rating (CRR)</a> represents OSFI's overall assessment of an institution's safety and soundness. There are four possible risk ratings: 'low,' 'moderate,' 'above average' and 'high'. The CRR is reported to most institutions at least once a year. (Certain inactive or voluntary wind-up institutions may not be rated). Supervisory information regulations prohibit institutions or OSFI from publicly disclosing their ratings. At the end of March 2019, OSFI had assigned CRR ratings of low or moderate to 94 percent, and above average or high to six percent of all CRR-rated institutions.</p>
      <h3>Intervention Ratings</h3>
      <p>As described in OSFI's <a href="/Eng/fi-if/rai-eri/Pages/gi.aspx">guides to intervention</a>, financial institutions are also assigned an intervention (stage) rating, which determines the degree of supervisory attention they receive. Broadly, these ratings are categorized as: normal (stage 0); early warning (stage 1); risk to financial viability or solvency (stage 2); future financial viability in serious doubt (stage 3); and non-viable/insolvency imminent (stage 4). At March 31, 2019, there were 27 staged institutions with a rating of Stage 1 or greater. With a few exceptions, most of the staged institutions were in the early warning (stage 1) category.</p>
