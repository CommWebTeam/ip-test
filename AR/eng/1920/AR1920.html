	 <h2>SUPERINTENDENT’S MESSAGE</h2>
<!-- image pull left -->
<p>As Canada’s prudential regulator and supervisor of banks, most of its insurance companies as well as a large number of private pension plans, our role is to make sure that these institutions and pension plans are in sound financial condition and prepared to navigate through a variety of circumstances. Doing so ensures that banks can continue to make loans and deposits available to Canadians; that insurance companies can pay policyholders; and that pension plans can continue to make payments to retirees. We also house the Office of the Chief Actuary (OCA), which is an independent unit that provides a range of actuarial valuation and advisory services to the federal government.</p>
<p>A large part of what we do is to think about and prepare for severe but plausible scenarios that can cause disruptions to the financial system. This past year we continued to monitor and assess financial risk adapting our approach to changing financial conditions; but we also focussed our efforts towards examining the impact that non-financial risks can have on institutions and how these risks ultimately will have prudential implications.</p>
<p>In spring 2020 with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we responded quickly to the disruptions in the economy by announcing a series of measures to support the Canadian financial system and protect pension plan members. Throughout this period, our guidance and actions continued to be credible, consistent and fit-for-purpose during these extraordinary circumstances while remaining risk-focused and forward-looking.</p>
<p>This year marked the first anniversary of the <a href="/Eng/wn-qn/Pages/strpln1922-nr.aspx"><em>2019-2022 OSFI Strategic Plan</em></a>. The plan, and in particular its four strategic goals, served us well this past year especially during challenging and unprecedented times. It provided us with our strategic direction and kept us focused on what we needed to do. Through this report, I am pleased to show our progress on this plan, which was realized through the ongoing commitment, dedication and professionalism of our employees.</p>
<p>As we continue to adjust to the <em>new normal</em>, Canadians can be confident that we are working hard to protect depositors, policyholders, creditors and private pension plan beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Jeremy Rudin<br/>
Superintendent</p>

<h2>OSFI’S VISION, MANDATE AND GOAL</h2>
<h3>Vision</h3>
<div class="pull-right" style="border: 1px solid black">
	<p>In February 2020, OSFI released its first <a href="https://t.co/9vN8O4UwyY?amp=1" rel="external">animated video</a> that provides an explanation of what OSFI does and its role in contributing to the stability of Canada’s financial system.</p>
</div>
<p>Building OSFI for today and tomorrow: preserving confidence, ever vigilant, always improving.</p>
<h3>Mandate</h3>
<p>Our mandate is to protect depositors, policyholders, financial institution creditors and pension plan members, while allowing financial institutions to compete and take reasonable risks.</p>
<p>Specifically we achieve this through:</p>

<h3>Strategic Plan</h3>
<p>In March 2019, we released the <a href="/Eng/wn-qn/Pages/strpln1922-nr.aspx"><em>2019-2022 OSFI Strategic Plan</em></a>. It focuses us on a core strategic agenda and lays out the expected criteria for success. Central to the plan are the four goals that guide all that we do.</p>
<p>Following the plan launch, each of our sectors undertook a planning process in line with the goals of the strategic plan. These sector plans responded to priorities identified in the strategic plan through activities, projects and allocated resources.</p>
<h3>Reporting Results</h3>
<p>Measuring our progress against the strategic plan is important not only in the actions that we take but also in the outcomes that we achieve. We made significant progress in advancing our strategic goals in 2019-20.</p>

<h2>OSFI’S OPERATING ENVIRONMENT – OVERVIEW OF KEY RISKS</h2>
<h3>Approach to Risk</h3>
<p>We aim to make sure that financial institutions are always prepared to continue functioning through a range of severe yet plausible economic scenarios. We evaluate if those preparations are adequate to deal with the potential impact of risks. This requires us to identify both <strong>financial</strong> and <strong>non-financial</strong> risks and ways to mitigate and manage these risks.</p>
<p>Our approach to supervision is risk-based to reflect the nature, size, complexity and risk profile of an institution, and allow these entities to take reasonable risks and compete effectively. Although we play an essential oversight role, the executive management and boards of directors of institutions and administrators of private pension plans are responsible for their success or failure.</p>
<p>We constantly evaluate system-wide developments that may have a negative impact on financial institutions and the financial system. While we are always scanning and monitoring the financial system environment, the following are the key financial and non-financial risks that we focussed on this year.</p>
<h4>Financial Risks</h4>
<p>Financial risks continued to be present for most of 2019-20.  The operating environment for federally regulated financial institutions was stable but challenging, and included slower economic growth and low interest rates together with a favourable credit environment and an increase in household debt.</p>
<h5>Residential Mortgage Risk</h5>
<p>Mortgage risk continued to be the largest risk that most federally regulated banks, trusts as well as some mortgage insurers carried in 2019-20. Lenders subject to our supervision held nearly 80 percent of all residential mortgages issued in Canada, and residential mortgage loans account for almost 30 percent of the total assets held by these lenders. For most of this year, this risk continued to be elevated given low interest rates and significant increases in household debt, particularly mortgage debt. This meant that any significant fall in housing prices would have led to material credit losses for lenders. Similarly, in the event of a significant and sustained increase in mortgage borrowing rates or the unemployment rate, repayment capacity by borrowers could have elevated the vulnerability of mortgage insurers to higher claims.</p>
<h5>Business Credit Risks</h5>
<p>In 2019-20, we also watched credit extension closely, particularly in the commercial real estate and oil and gas sectors. Both of these markets are highly cyclical; a market downturn could have negatively affected asset values resulting in financial losses.</p>
<p>Another area of increased risk monitoring was debt to the non-financial corporate sector. Business debt has seen significant growth in the past few years, and last year was no exception, with a growing proportion of weaker structures, e.g. less strict loan covenants (conditions on borrowers).</p>
<h5>Climate Risk</h5>
<p>This year, we focused some of our work on the impact that climate risk can have on the financial position of insurance companies, as some insurers had direct exposure to increasing insurance claims for property damage. Specifically, a key trend was that climate-related property damage has risen in recent years in Canada from extensive wildfires, ice storms, floods and tornadoes.</p>
<p>Litigation related to climate change continued to rise and defendants in these lawsuits have some liability insurance coverage, which means that their insurers are also exposed. The eventual cost of liability claims is often uncertain and cases can take decades to unfold. Finally, we also closely monitored the transition risk that arises from efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, this can effect the value of investments that insurers have as well as increase the risk for banks on the value of loans and other exposures in affected industries.</p>
<h5>COVID-19-Related Risks</h5>
<p>In March 2020 as COVID-19 began causing disruptions to Canadian business operations and the economy, it also raised unprecedented uncertainty and risk to the financial system. Financial institutions needed to adapt quickly to the new economic environment as well as a new operating environment that relied heavily on telework. During this period, we closely monitored the situation and evaluated the short- and long-term impacts that the business interruption as well as the credit worthiness of borrowers has had on financial institutions. We also suspended policy development in light of the extraordinary demands on financial institutions operations.</p>
<h4>Non-Financial Risks</h4>
<p>In 2019-2020, we increased our response to non-financial risks by building new capability and infrastructure to treat it as key component of financial safety and soundness. In all cases of non-financial risk, we are most concerned with how these risks can materialize as financial risk. An emphasis on <em>financial loss</em> focuses our work on our overarching prudential mandate and overarching concern with solvency; however, it is important to recognize that losses due to data breaches, reputation damage, etc. are in most instances the most likely immediate impact of many non-financial risks.</p>
<h5>Technology Risk</h5>
<p>Technology risk is the risk of financial loss arising from the inadequacy, misuse, significant disruption or failure of information technology governance, systems, processes and assets. In 2019-20, we monitored trends in the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning models as they continued to become an integral part of the operating models of financial institutions.</p>
<h5>Cyber Security Risk</h5>
<p>A component of technology risk is cyber security risk. In 2019-20, we saw a rise in the number of cyber-related threats and incidents against financial institutions, some of which garnered significant public profile and media attention. According to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, it is estimated that over <a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/blog/20191031/" rel="external">28 million Canadians</a> were affected by a data breach that involved information loss or theft in 2019, making the impact of this non-financial risk one of the most critical we monitored during this time period. Additionally, early in the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw increased trends in fraud activity with related phishing and malware, which has amplified these cyber threats as well as an increase in cyber security attacks against third-party information technology and professional services providers.</p>
<h5>Culture and Conduct</h5>
<p>Culture risk is a non-financial risk that is qualitative in nature, difficult to quantify and unique to each institution. An organization’s culture can influence the effectiveness of its risk management, potentially leading to excessive risk-taking and negative financial and reputational outcomes. In 2019, we identified that institutions are at various stages in developing programs to mitigate the risk of misconduct. In response to COVID-19, the primary focus of our risk monitoring and supervision shifted towards the elevated people risks in the pandemic environment and operations.</p>

<h2>OSFI’S WORK: DEPOSIT-TAKING INSTITUTIONS</h2>
<p>We regulate and supervise deposit-taking institutions (DTIs) including banks, foreign bank branches, trust and loan companies, and cooperatives.</p>
<p>The federally regulated deposit-taking industry in Canada comprises six large domestic banks designated as domestic systemically important banks (DSIBs), four mid-tier institutions, and many smaller institutions. Two of the larger banks (Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto Dominion Bank) have been designated global systemically important by the Financial Stability Board.</p>
<p>The six largest banks account for 90 percent of total assets held by federally regulated deposit-taking institutions. Their diversified business lines extend beyond traditional deposit-taking and lending activities to trading, investment banking, wealth management and insurance. In addition to their primary domestic focus, these large banks operate in many other countries.</p>
<p>Small and medium-sized institutions account for the other ten percent of assets. These institutions pursue various market and business strategies such as mortgage lending, commercial real estate lending and credit card lending.</p>
<p>We closely monitor economic, financial and non-financial risks facing deposit-taking institutions, including system-wide or sector developments that could have a negative impact on their financial condition.</p>
<h3>Deposit-Taking Institutions Environment</h3>
<p>In 2019-20 prior to COVID-19, the overall performance of DTIs was strong. This was primarily due to solid net income generation and a mainly favourable credit environment.</p>
<div class="pull-right" style="border: 1px solid black">
	<p>More detailed financial information on the institutions subject to OSFI regulation and supervision is available through the <a href="/Eng/wt-ow/Pages/fd-df.aspx">Financial Data</a> application on our website.</p>
</div>
<p>In this period, we focused our efforts on monitoring and addressing the key risks and vulnerabilities that faced financial institutions including those related to mortgage lending, which continued to be elevated given low interest rates and significant increases in household debt, particularly mortgage debt.</p>
<p>Other risks that we were monitoring included elevated credit risk in retail, commercial and consumer lending, and corporate and commercial sectors. In early 2020, the primary focus of our risk monitoring and supervision shifted towards the financial and operational risks associated with COVID-19.</p>
<h3>Sound Mortgage Underwriting</h3>
<p>In 2019-20, we took measures to promote sound mortgage underwriting practices to reduce risks to the financial system. Specifically, our supervisory reviews of deposit-taking institutions ensured that the institutions applied appropriate standards and had adequate controls to assess a borrower’s ability to pay their loan under a variety of conditions.</p>
<div class="pull-left" style="border: 1px solid black">
	<img src="#" alt="#" />
</div>
<p>In June 2019, we <a href="/Eng/wn-qn/Pages/b20-nfo.aspx">released an update</a> outlining how B-20 was contributing to the safety and soundness of Canada’s financial system. It showed fewer approved mortgages for highly indebted or over-leveraged individuals; the stress test did not affect a borrower’s ability to renew; and individuals were not taking on longer amortization rates because of the stress test. We <a href="/Eng/wn-qn/Pages/bg20200124.aspx">updated these findings</a> in January 2020, and our conclusions remained consistent with the original findings that showed the stress test was performing as intended.</p>
<p>In January 2020, we also signaled that we were <a href="/Eng/wn-qn/Pages/bg20200124.aspx">reviewing the benchmark</a> rate due to the widening between it and contract rates. We observed that the benchmark was less responsive to market changes than when it was first proposed. In February 2020, we announced the launch of <a href="/Eng/wn-qn/Pages/bnchrt-let.aspx">consultations</a> on this issue to seek perspectives and input. We suspended the consultations due to the onset of COVID-19 in March 2020.</p>
<h3>The Domestic Stability Buffer</h3>
<div class="pull-right" style="border: 1px solid black">
	<img src="#" alt="#" />
</div>
<p>The Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) is a capital buffer requirement for domestic systemically important banks (DSIBs). The DSB’s countercyclical design enables DSIBs to use capital during challenging times that they had set aside during more stable economic conditions.</p>
<p>We announced increases to the DSB in <a href="/Eng/wn-qn/Pages/dsb201906.aspx">June 2019</a> and <a href="/Eng/wn-qn/Pages/dsb20191210.aspx">December 2019</a>. In June 2019, we raised the DSB from 1.75 % to 2.00% of risk-weighted assets noting that Canadian household indebtedness, asset imbalances and institutional indebtedness remained elevated.  In December, we raised the DSB further to 2.25% after seeing continued growth in household indebtedness, asset imbalances and institutional indebtedness as well as global vulnerabilities related to rising trade tensions and leverage. These raises took place during a time when economic conditions were favourable. In both instances, we reached out to news media, analysts and industry partners to communicate our decision and explain further details.</p>
<p>On March 13, 2020, responding to the uncertainty that COVID-19 was causing in Canada’s financial system, a series of coordinated announcements were made in an unprecedented news conference with the Minister of Finance, the Governor of the Bank of Canada and the Superintendent of Financial Institutions. At that news conference, the Superintendent <a href="/Eng/wn-qn/Pages/20200313.aspx">announced</a> the lowering of the DSB by 1.25% of risk-weighted assets to 1.00% from 2.25%. The lowering of the DSB supported in excess of $300B of additional lending capacity for the DSIBs to supply credit to the economy during an expected period of disruption. We also committed to not increasing the buffer for at least 18 months and signaled our readiness to lower the DSB further, if conditions required.</p>
<h3>Climate Risk</h3>
<p>In 2019-20, we joined the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s high-level task force on climate-related financial risks, where we shared regulatory and supervisory initiatives with other banking regulators.</p>
<h3>Response to COVID-19</h3>
<div class="pull-left" style="border: 1px solid black">
	<img src="#" alt="#" />
</div>
<p>An effective capital regime ensures that banks are holding adequate capital to protect against risks and encourages them to use their buffers during times of stress to avoid unnecessary sales of assets or drastic reductions in lending. As mentioned, <a href="/Eng/osfi-bsif/med/Pages/nr_20200313.aspx">releasing this buffer</a> was an important measure we took early in responding to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial system.  Other measures we took in response to the impact of COVID-19 included:</p>
<ul>

<h3>Guidance</h3>
<p>We regulate and play an important oversight role by developing guidelines, policies and procedures for institutions designed to control and manage risk. In doing so, we balance the goals of safety and soundness with the need for institutions to take reasonable risks and compete. In 2019-20, we issued the following guidance for DTIs:</p>
<p>In April 2019, we released an updated guideline on <a href="/Eng/wn-qn/Pages/b220190410-nr.aspx">large exposure limits for domestic systemically important banks</a>. The revised guideline incorporated the new Basel committee standard and provided additional guidance on risk management practices that we expected DSIBs to use for identifying, measuring, managing and monitoring large exposures. All other federally regulated DTIs remained subject to the original version of Guideline B-2.</p>
<p>Also in April 2019, we published the revised <a href="/Eng/wn-qn/Pages/LAR19.aspx">Liquidity Adequacy Requirements (LAR) guideline</a> to include targeted modifications related to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Cumulative Cash Flow (NCCF) metrics. This change promoted the safety and soundness of institutions and better reflected the increased risks posed by different types of retail deposits that may be subject to sudden withdrawals. The revised guideline also includes final rules to incorporate the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) for DSIBs.</p>
<p>The NSFR is a long-term structural liquidity metric that promotes funding stability and reduces the likelihood that a disruption to an institution’s regular sources of funding will erode its liquidity position in a way that could increase the risk of its failure. In April 2019, we issued guidance related to NSFR public disclosure requirements that will be fully implemented in 2021.</p>
<p>We updated <a href="/Eng/wn-qn/Pages/a10.aspx">Guideline A-10: Foreign Bank Branch Deposit Requirement</a> in December 2019 to reflect current practices and simplify the document, which was last published in 2002.</p>
<p>In May 2019, we released final revisions to <a href="/Eng/wn-qn/Pages/b12-nr.aspx">Guideline B-12: Interest Rate Risk Management</a>, which provides a risk control framework for managing interest rate risk levels at institutions.</p>
<p>The revised guideline took effect in January 2020 for DSIBs. For all other institutions, the current version will apply until the end of 2021, after which the revised version will apply.</p>
<p>We released final updates to <a href="/Eng/wn-qn/Pages/b6-2020.aspx">Guideline B-6: Liquidity Principles</a> in December 2019 to set out our expectations around the management of institutions’ liquidity risk. The changes ensured that it remains current and relevant as well as appropriate for the scale and complexity of institutions. It also includes additional clarity on liquidity risk management practices.</p>
<p>In January 2020, we issued a <a href="/Eng/wn-qn/Pages/SMSB20_CP.aspx">consultative document</a> on an initiative to develop more tailored minimum capital and liquidity requirements for small and medium-sized DTIs (i.e. SMSB Proportionality). It provided an overview of the feedback from a July 2019 discussion paper and an update on Pillar 1 capital and liquidity requirements. This work was in preparation of the rollout of a new framework that will coincide with the domestic implementation of the final Basel 3 reforms, currently expected in 2023.</p>
<h3>Addressing Non-Financial Risk</h3>
<p>This year we undertook a number of measures to address some emerging and evolving non-financial risks facing deposit-taking institutions. Specifically, we examined the approach taken to technology risk by other prudential regulators. Following this, we initiated dialogue with industry stakeholders and developed a draft discussion paper that outlined an approach to technology risk that could be applied in the Canadian context. This included completing a survey of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) use, development and deployment by financial institutions.</p>
<p>Recognizing how advances in technology has grown and evolved in the financial services industry in the decade since we last revised Guideline B-10 in 2009, in 2019-20 we completed a study of third-party risk management practices at a subset of financial institutions. We identified five focus areas (risk assessment, monitoring and incident management, data security and access, continuity of critical operations, and cloud risk management) that can contribute to the effective management of third-party risk.</p>
<p>When responding to increased cyber security risk this year, we shared anonymized threat and incident information through intelligence bulletins and information sharing sessions at industry forums. These bulletins provided early warnings to institutions and identified potential areas of vulnerabilities so that the institutions could focus preventative efforts accordingly. We also conducted a cyber-risk crisis simulated exercise with one large bank and one insurer to enhance the Incident Response Protocol, share lessons learned, and to help inform regulatory and supervisory expectations and their link to financial risk, including reputation risk.</p>
<p>Recognizing that an institution’s culture is a key dimension in ensuring effective risk management, in 2019, we undertook a culture scan with 10 DTIs to take stock of the range of practices, processes and tools institutions use in developing, governing, promoting and monitoring their culture. This data is foundational work for the development of methodology for assessing culture to accurately measure and mitigate the financial impact of this risk.  Additionally, to provide practical guidance in advancing this work, we established the Culture External Advisory Committee in 2019 consisting of retired senior leaders from the financial services industry, academics and current leaders from other industries that have a strong safety or risk management culture.</p>

<h2>OSFI’S WORK: INSURANCE</h2>
<p>We regulate and supervise life, property and casualty and mortgage insurance companies as well as fraternal benefit societies.</p>
<p>The federally regulated <strong>life insurance</strong> industry in Canada comprises three large institutions and more than 70 domestic companies and foreign branches. The large insurers account for more than 90 percent of the assets, and have operations in Canada, the U.S., Europe and Asia. They offer a broad range of wealth management, life and health insurance products through a number of distribution channels, while the smaller insurers are more restricted in product breadth and distribution.</p>
<p>We supervise 150 <strong>property and causality</strong> (P&amp;C) insurers, with annual premiums of $55 billion and assets of $175 billion. The top 10 institutions represent 64 percent of total assets.</p>
<p>The <strong>mortgage insurance</strong> industry in Canada consists of three participants: two private sector insurers that we regulate; and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), which is a Crown corporation subject to our oversight.</p>
<p>A fraternal benefit society is an institution operated for fraternal, benevolent or religious purposes, including the insurance of members or the spouses or children of members, against accident, sickness, disability or death. There are only 12 in Canada and they are subject to our supervision and regulation.</p>
<p>We closely monitor risks facing insurers that could have a negative impact on their financial condition. We are making risk assessments and intervening as necessary to ensure that the industry remains prepared and resilient to financial risks during stress events.</p>
<h3>Insurance Institutions Environment</h3>
<p>Predominantly, 2019-20 saw continued growth in equity markets; however beginning in early 2020, challenges posed by low long-term interest rates, COVID-19 and heightened market volatility brought increased uncertainty for the <strong>life insurance industry</strong>. Insurers managed disruptions to operations through the implementation of business continuity plans and other response measures.</p>
<div class="pull-left" style="border: 1px solid black">
	<p>More detailed financial information on the institutions subject to OSFI regulation and supervision is available through the <a href="/Eng/wt-ow/Pages/fd-df.aspx">Financial Data</a> application on our website.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>The property and casualty (P&amp;C) industry</strong> reported higher net income in 2019 due to increases in both underwriting and investment income. Measures of core profitability also showed a slight increase due mainly to lower catastrophe losses and improving commercial market conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Mortgage insurers</strong> achieved favourable financial performance during 2019, supported by higher underwriting income and net investment income. In 2019-20, mortgage insurers remained vulnerable to rising consumer debt levels and the risk of a housing price correction in certain markets.</p>
<h3>International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 17</h3>
<p><em>IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts</em> is an international financial reporting standard issued by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Accounting_Standards_Board" rel="external">International Accounting Standards Board</a> (IASB) in May 2017. This year we saw Canadian insurers allocating a substantial proportion of their resources to prepare for its implementation. This included accommodating significant changes to systems, operations and financial reporting. In March 2020, the IASB deferred the effective date of to January 1, 2023, along with the exemption to implement IFRS 9 Financial Instruments for some insurers.</p>
<p>In June 2019, we released draft capital guidelines updated for IFRS 17 and followed up by conducting a quantitative impact study (QIS) to assess insurers’ capital ratios under that draft framework. This consultation resulted in enhancements to the Life Insurance Capital Adequacy Test (LICAT) draft guidelines. Following this, in November 2019, we issued for <a href="/Eng/wn-qn/Pages/irpc_irfs17_let.aspx">public consultation</a> draft regulatory forms and instructions to support IFRS 17 implementation. This consultation work was paused due to the onset of COVD-19 in March 2020.</p>
<p>Throughout 2019-20, we continued monitoring implementation progress of this new standard by insurance companies through the semi-annual progress reporting process. In August 2019, we provided an <a href="/Eng/wn-qn/Pages/ifrs17-let.aspx">update to industry</a> on the milestones completed and activities underway to support a robust implementation of IFRS 17.</p>
<h3>Reinsurance</h3>
<p>Reinsurance in its most basic form is insurance for insurance companies. A comprehensive review of reinsurance practices has been a key initiative for us over the past few years. In June 2018, we issued a discussion paper that included proposals to enhance and clarify expectations for prudent reinsurance practices.  Building on this work, in June 2019 we issued a revised <a href="/Eng/fi-if/rg-ro/gdn-ort/gl-ld/Pages/b3-dft.aspx">B-3 -- Sound Reinsurance Practices and Procedures</a>, which incorporated the feedback from the consultations.  Over the past year, we have also continued to work on proposals aimed to address risks associated with large exposures and concentration.   In this regard, we did a qualitative impact survey (QIS) and solicited other feedback from the industry.</p>
<h3>Climate Risk</h3>
<p>In 2019-20, we continued our work on climate risk and worked closely with counterparts around the world to share ideas and experience in this area, including the UN-sponsored grouping of financial regulators called the Sustainable Insurance Forum. We were also involved in the climate-related work of the International Association of Insurance Supervisors.</p>
<h3>Response to COVID-19</h3>
<p>In response to challenges posed by COVID-19, we introduced a series of regulatory flexibility measures to help reduce some of the operational stress on institutions and assist insurers in responding to customers who were managing through hardships. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
	<li>increasing supervisory dialogue with institutions</li>
	<li><a href="/Eng/osfi-bsif/med/Pages/nr_20200327.aspx">suspending semi-annual progress reporting</a> on the implementation of the new reporting standards such as IFRS 17 <em>Insurance Contracts</em></li>
	<li><a href="/Eng/osfi-bsif/med/Pages/nr_20200313.aspx">pausing the November 2019 public consultation</a> of draft regulatory forms and instructions to support IFRS 17; the publication of the final version of Guideline E-25; and the February 2020 public consultation of the updates to the LICAT framework</li>
	<li><a href="/Eng/osfi-bsif/med/Pages/nr_20200327.aspx">ensuring that loan payment deferrals</a> will not increase capital charges on mortgages, leases or loans</li>
</ul>
<h3>Guidance</h3>
<p>In June 2019, we sought comments from the P&amp;C industry on a draft guideline <a href="/Eng/wn-qn/Pages/e25-dft.aspx">Internal Model and Oversight Framework (E-25)</a>. The guideline outlined our expectations for insurers when they establish and maintain an oversight framework for internal models used to determine regulatory capital requirements.</p>
<p>In February 2020, we launched a <a href="/Eng/wn-qn/Pages/LICAT20.aspx">public consultation</a> on updates to the Life Insurance Capital Adequacy Test (LICAT) framework to modify an area of the test that could cause some unwarranted volatility, and to clarify an area where the wording of the guideline could lead to a misinterpretation.</p>
<h3>Addressing Non-Financial Risks</h3>
<p>In 2019-20, the digitization of financial services created new competitive challenges for insurers. Similar to the work undertaken in this area for DTIs, this past year emphasis was placed on monitoring and work related to managing technology risk as well as collaborating with other regulators in this area.  One of the insurance companies we supervise participated in a tabletop exercise on a potential cyber security risk that was used to refine our Incident Response Protocol.</p>
<p>Insurers have also been evolving their use of third parties since the revision of Guideline B-10 in 2009. As such, a subset of life, property and casualty, and mortgage insurers were included in the third-party study where we identified five focus areas that can contribute to the effective management of third-party risk.</p>
<p>The industry culture scan undertaken in 2019 also included 10 insurance companies, varying in size and activity, to understand the range of practices in their governance, promotion, assessment and monitoring of culture.</p>

<h2>OSFI’S WORK: REGULATION</h2>
<p>In addition to creating, implementing and enforcing regulatory guidance and expectations to the industries we supervise, we regulate by interpreting legislation and providing approvals for some transactions.</p>
<h3>Legislation</h3>
<p>In keeping with the objectives of enhancing the transparency of the legislative approval process and promoting a better understanding of our interpretation of the federal financial institution statutes, in 2019-20, we issued a new advisory regarding mergers involving foreign entities, and revised advisories regarding control in fact, and corporate names, registered names and trade names.</p>
<h3>Approvals</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-1.01/index.html" rel="external"><em>Bank Act</em></a>, <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/t-19.8/" rel="external"><em>Trust and Loan Companies Act</em> and <em>Insurance Companies Act</em></a> require federally regulated financial institutions to seek regulatory approval from the Superintendent or the Minister of Finance prior to engaging in certain transactions or business undertakings.</p>
<p>Regulatory approvals are also required by persons wishing to incorporate an institution, and by foreign banks or foreign insurance companies wishing to establish a presence or to make certain investments in Canada.</p>
<div class="pull-left" style="border: 1px solid black">
	<img src="#" alt="#"/>
</div>
<p>In 2019-20 we processed 146 applications, of which 131 were approved and 15 were withdrawn. The majority of approved applications related to banks (45%) and P&amp;C insurers (28%).</p>
<p>The most common applications received from DTIs related to purchases or redemptions of shares or debentures, transfers of assets in excess of 10 percent, changes in ownership, and substantial investments. For insurance companies, the most common applications related to purchases or redemptions of shares or debentures, amending orders to commence and carry on business or insure in Canada risks, reinsurance with related unregistered reinsurers, and changes in ownership.</p>
<p>Letters patent were granted incorporating Peoples Bank of Canada as a domestic bank. In addition, orders to insure in Canada risks were issued to AWP Health &amp; Life SA and Validus Reinsurance, Ltd., establishing them as foreign insurance branches in Canada.</p>
<p>Upon request, we also provide advance capital confirmations on the eligibility of proposed regulatory capital instruments. We provided a total of 21 such opinions and validations in 2019-20, compared to 20 the previous year.</p>

<h2>OSFI’S WORK: PRIVATE PENSION PLANS</h2>
<p>We regulate and supervise more than 1,200 federally regulated private pension plans in federally regulated areas of employment such as banking, inter-provincial transportation and telecommunications. These plans represent 1.15 million active members and hold assets of about $215.5 billion. We develop guidance on risk management and mitigation, assessing whether plans are meeting their funding requirements and managing risks effectively, and intervening promptly when we identify the need for corrective actions. Pension plan administrators are ultimately responsible for sound and prudent management of their plans.</p>
<h3>Private Pension Plan Environment</h3>
<p>Federally regulated pension plans ended 2019 with an overall improved financial position compared to the beginning of the year. In the first quarter of 2020, COVID-19 affected both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Defined benefit plan sponsors saw an impact to both plan assets and liabilities, as equity market declines reduced asset values and the continued drop in bond yields increased liabilities.</p>
<h3>Risk-Based Reviews</h3>
<p>In effort to identify areas where we can strengthen our principles and risk-based approaches to pension plan supervision, in 2019-20, we continued two major reviews of our pensions program. The first examined how we supervise investments of plans.  The second assessed how we supervise plans with defined contribution (DC) provisions. While these reviews are still ongoing based on preliminary findings, we expect recommendations to include adjusted annual reporting requirements and updated guidance.</p>
<p>We also launched two additional initiatives: a review of the consideration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in plan investment decisions and the analysis of the potential risks associated with technology, including cyber and third-party risk.</p>
<h3>Actuarial Reports</h3>
<p>We review actuarial reports for defined benefit plans, and if risks are noted the report is reviewed more in-depth. Nearly 290 actuarial reports were filed in 2019-20, and 48 were subjected to more in-depth review. During the in-depth review we discussed issues raised with the plans’ actuaries, particularly when these concerns have an impact on current and future funding requirements.  Our interventions resulted in some plans being required to amend and re-submit their actuarial report.</p>
<h3>Examinations</h3>
<p>During 2019-20, we completed eight examinations as part of our risk-based supervisory approach.</p>
<h3>Response to COVID-19</h3>
<p>In response to COVID-19, we <a href="/Eng/pp-rr/ppa-rra/Pages/Pen20200327_let.aspx">adjusted our policies</a> to protect the interests of pension plan members and beneficiaries and to allow plan administrators to focus their efforts on addressing the many challenges posed by the crisis. In addition to extending filing deadlines and suspending a number of consultation initiatives and policy development work, we implemented a temporary freeze on portability transfers and annuity purchases relating to defined benefit provisions of pension plans.</p>
<h3>Guidance</h3>
<p>In 2019-20, we issued three revised instruction guides in draft form so that plan stakeholders have the opportunity to provide input, although the onset of COVID-19 in March 2020 required these <a href="/Eng/osfi-bsif/med/Pages/nr_20200313.aspx">consultations to be suspended</a>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>proposed revisions to an instruction guide for authorization of amendments reducing benefits in defined benefit plans</li>
	<li>a draft revised instruction guide for the preparation of actuarial reports for defined benefit pension plans</li>
	<li>a revised instruction guide for the termination of a defined benefit pension plan (The revisions reflect amendments to the Assessment of Pension Plans Regulations that came into effect April 1, 2019, and remove references to pre-2016 PBSA requirements on information for members and former members.)</li>
</ul>
<p>In December 2019, we posted a contribution planner <a href="/Eng/wn-qn/Pages/cntbtn-frm.aspx"><em>Schedule of Expected Contributions Form</em></a> to assist plan administrators and fund trustees or custodians in meeting their obligations under the PBSA to provide information in writing to the trustee or custodian of the pension fund of all remitted amounts and to report late remittances.</p>
<p>Throughout the first quarter of 2020, we issued revised instruction guides and forms to improve the quality and usefulness of data collected and assist plan administrators in completing and submitting annual regulatory filings. More specifically, revisions were made to the instruction guides and accompanying forms for completing and filing the <a href="/Eng/pp-rr/ppa-rra/afr-emda/Pages/air_gde_20.aspx">annual information return</a> (AIR), the <a href="/Eng/pp-rr/ppa-rra/afr-emda/Pages/air_gde_20.aspx">pension plan annual corporate certification</a> (PPAC), the <a href="/Eng/pp-rr/ppa-rra/afr-emda/Pages/cfs_gde_20.aspx">certified financial statements</a> (CFS), the <a href="/Eng/pp-rr/ppa-rra/afr-emda/Pages/arf_gde_20.aspx">audited financial statements</a> (AFS), the <a href="/Eng/pp-rr/ppa-rra/afr-emda/Pages/sir_gde.aspx">solvency information return</a> (SIR), the <a href="/Eng/pp-rr/ppa-rra/afr-emda/Pages/ais.aspx">actuarial information summary</a> (AIS) and the <a href="/Eng/pp-rr/ppa-rra/af-ac/Pages/rpis.aspx">replicating portfolio information summary</a> (RPIS).</p>
<h3>Approvals</h3>
<p>Federally regulated private pension plans are required to seek approval from the Superintendent for several types of transactions: plan registrations and terminations; asset transfers between registered defined benefit pension plans; refunds of surplus; and reductions of accrued benefits. In 2019-20, 40 pension transactions were submitted for approval, compared to 63 in 2018-19. We processed 42 applications for approval in 2019-20, compared to 47 the previous year.</p>
<p>In 2019-20, 16 new plans were registered (two defined benefit/combination and 14 defined contribution), while 19 plan termination reports were approved (10 defined benefit/combination and nine defined contribution).</p>
<h3>InfoPensions</h3>
<p>We published our newsletter, <em>InfoPensions</em> in <a href="/Eng/Docs/ip/201905/index.html">May</a> and <a href="/Eng/Docs/ip/201911/index.html">November</a> 2019. It included announcements and reminders for plan administrators, pension advisors and other stakeholders as well as descriptions of how we apply provisions of the pension legislation and its guidance.</p>

<h2>OSFI’S WORK WITH PARTNERS</h2>
<h3>DOMESTIC</h3>
<div class="pull-left" style="border: 1px solid black">
	<img src="#" alt="#"/>
</div>
<p>We report to Parliament through the Minister of Finance and work closely with federal partners, including the Department of Finance, the Bank of Canada, the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) and the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada. We also work with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) and consult with provincial counterparts and industry stakeholders.</p>
<p>In 2019-20, we continued to hold regular meetings with our partners and industry stakeholders as well as participated in an annual crisis management exercise in conjunction with CDIC to assess institutional preparedness.</p>
<h4>Domestic Accounting, Auditing and Actuarial Standards</h4>
<p>Our supervision and regulation of financial institutions places strong reliance on the quality of audited financial statements. For this reason, we actively participate in domestic standard-setting and oversight bodies related to Canadian auditing and accounting standards.</p>
<p>In October 2019, we co-hosted, with the Canadian Public Accountability Board (CPAB) a <a href="/Eng/wn-qn/Pages/nr_20191120.aspx">roundtable</a> on audit quality. The forum provided an opportunity for more than forty of Canada’s public accounting and regulatory leaders to discuss ways to support continued financial system stability by enhancing public confidence in audit quality.</p>
<p>In 2019-20, we also participated on the CIA IFRS 17 steering committee and several CIA standards and guidance committees. This work culminated in new Financial Condition Testing (FCT) standards and guidance, replacing the DCAT. We also participated in two Actuarial Standards Board (ASB) designated groups related to the implementation of IFRS 17, including the impact on the role of the actuary.</p>
<h3>INTERNATIONAL</h3>
<p>International organizations play a key role in the development of regulatory frameworks for banks and insurers that contribute to a strong and stable global financial system. We have earned a strong international reputation through our active participation in such organizations, which allows it to share a Canadian perspective, and help shape the development of regulatory and supervisory rules and accounting and actuarial standards.</p>
<h4><a href="https://www.fsb.org/" rel="external">Financial Stability Board (FSB)</a></h4>
<p>Canadian representation includes the Department of Finance, the Bank of Canada and OSFI. During 2019-20, our role included membership on the FSB Plenary, Steering Committee, and Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation as well as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>finalizing a report evaluating the effects of financial reforms on small and medium-sized enterprise financing</li>
	<li>publishing an issues note on the regulatory issues associated with the emergence of global stablecoins</li>
	<li>publishing a report assessing the financial stability implications of the entry into finance of Bigtech firms as well as third party dependencies associated with cloud services</li>
	<li>publishing a report assessing the financial stability implications of developments in the leveraged loan and CLO markets</li>
	<li>continuing a multi-year evaluation of the effects of reforms to end the concept of too-big-to-fail as well as work to address the risk of market fragmentation</li>
	<li>working with standard-setting bodies to finalize and operationalize the implementation of G20 post-crisis financial sector reforms in insurance and resolution regimes</li>
</ul>
<h4><a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/" rel="external">Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)</a></h4>
<p>We are an active member of the BCBS, which provides a forum for international rulemaking and cooperation on banking supervisory matters. This year we continued to work closely with the BCBS on a number of important initiatives.</p>
<p>In July 2019, as part of its Regulatory Consistency Assessment Programme (RCAP), <a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d473.htm" rel="external">the BCBS published separate reports</a> related to the Canadian implementation of the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) and of the large exposure framework. The assessments found that the Canadian NSFR and large exposure framework are compliant with the Basel Committee's global standards, which is the highest grade possible.</p>
<p>In March 2020, as part of regulatory flexibility measures related to COVID-19, we <a href="/Eng/osfi-bsif/med/Pages/nr_20200327.aspx">announced a deferral</a> of the following implementation dates of the Basel 3 reform package, <a href="https://www.bis.org/press/p200327.htm" rel="external">in line with the delay in the international implementation timeline</a> by the group of Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS), the BCBS’s oversight body.</p>
<p>Finally, in <a href="https://www.bis.org/press/p191031a.htm" rel="external">October 2019</a> the BCBS announced that Canada (ourselves and the Bank of Canada) would host the 2020 International Conference on Banking Supervision (ICBS). The ICBS is held every two years and brings together senior central bankers and bank supervisors from more than 100 countries as well as representatives of international financial institutions. The conference promotes the discussion of key supervisory issues and fosters continuing cooperation in the oversight of international banking.</p>
<h4><a href="https://www.iaisweb.org/home" rel="external">International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS)</a></h4>
<p>This past year we continued to be an active member in several committees and working groups, including the Executive Committee, Policy Development Committee and two of its working groups: the Macroprudential Committee and the Supervisory Forum.  In this capacity, in November 2019, we contributed to the development of the following frameworks adopted by the IAIS:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Common Framework (ComFrame), which establishes supervisory minimum standards and guidance for the group-wide supervision of internationally active insurance groups (IAIGs)</li>
	<li>Holistic Framework for the Assessment and Mitigation of Systemic Risk in the Insurance Sector (the Holistic Framework)</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the ComFrame development, the IAIS adopted a global Insurance Capital Standard Version 2.0 (ICS) for a five-year monitoring period. We were broadly supportive of the goals of the ICS but <a href="/Eng/osfi-bsif/med/Pages/ics20191114-nr.aspx">did not support the design of the standard</a> because it was not appropriate for the Canadian market.</p>
<h4>Colleges of Supervisors</h4>
<p>In 2019-20, we hosted seven colleges involving large banks and insurers.  At these events, we invite international regulators to <em>Colleges of Supervisors</em> sessions. We also conducted quarterly conference calls with them to identify potential issues in their jurisdiction before they manifest and attended the colleges of companies with significant operations in Canada.</p>
<h4>International Accounting and Auditing Standards</h4>
<p>As all federally regulated financial institutions in Canada are required to follow International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International Standards on Auditing (ISA), we interpret and assess international rules that may apply to Canadian financial institutions. In 2019-20, we worked through the BCBS and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors to provide comment letters, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>International Accounting Standards Board on:
		<ul>
			<li><em>interest rate benchmark reform phase 1 amendments</em> (June 2019)</li>
			<li><em>amendments to IFRS 17 Insurance contracts</em> (Sept. 2019)</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) on:
		<ul>
			<li><em>IAASB proposed strategy for 2020-23 and work plan for 2020-21</em> (June 2019)</li>

<h2>OFFICE OF THE CHIEF ACTUARY</h2>
<p>The Office of the Chief Actuary (OCA) contributes to a financially sound and sustainable Canadian public retirement income system by providing expert actuarial services to the Government of Canada and to provincial governments that are Canada Pension Plan (CPP) stakeholders.</p>
<p>The OCA provides actuarial valuation and advisory services for the CPP, the Old Age Security (OAS) program, the Canada Student Loans Program and the Employment Insurance program, as well as for pension and benefits plans covering the federal public service, the Canadian Forces, the RCMP, federally appointed judges and members of Parliament.</p>
<p>The OCA operates from within OSFI as an independent and impartial unit. Although the Chief Actuary reports to the Superintendent, the accountability framework of the OCA makes it clear that its staff is solely responsible for actuarial advice provided.</p>
<h3>The 30<sup>th</sup> Actuarial Report on the CPP</h3>
<p>The OCA is required to produce an actuarial report on the CPP every three years. The <a href="/Eng/wn-qn/Pages/CPP30-1210.aspx"><em>30th Actuarial Report on the CPP as at 31 December 2018</em></a> was tabled in Parliament on December 10, 2019. It includes projections of CPP revenues and expenditures over the 75-year projection period so that the impact of historical and projected trends on demographic and economic factors can be properly assessed.</p>
<p>As of January 1, 2019, the CPP has two components: the base and additional plans. The CPP consisted only of the base plan (or base CPP) prior to 2019, and this component continues. The additional plan (or additional CPP) is the new enhancement as of 2019. Unlike the base CPP, the additional CPP is fully funded. The <em>30th Actuarial Report on the CPP as at 31 December 2018</em> is the first report that combines the assessment of both CPP components.</p>
<h3>External Peer Review of the 30<sup>th</sup> CPP Actuarial Report</h3>
<p>In 2019-20, the OCA commissioned <a href="">an external peer review of the <em>30th CPP Actuarial Report</em></a>. First introduced in 1999, the external peer review of actuarial reports by an independent panel of reviewers is to ensure that actuarial reports meet high professional standards, and based on reasonable assumptions in order to provide sound actuarial advice to Canadians.</p>
<p>The independent panel’s findings confirm that the work performed by the OCA on the <em>30th CPP Actuarial Report</em> meets professional standards of practice and statutory requirements; the assumptions and methods used are reasonable; and the report fairly communicates the results of the work performed by the Chief Actuary and staff.</p>
<h3>The 15th Actuarial Report on the Old Age Security Program</h3>
<p>The legislation following proposals in the 2019 federal budget has enhanced the income exemption for the Guaranteed Income Supplement and Allowance. The OCA prepared the <em>15th Actuarial Report Supplementing the Actuarial Report on the Old Age Security Program as at 31 December 2015</em>, which was tabled in Parliament on August 21, 2019.</p>
<h3>Public Sector Pension and Benefit Plans</h3>
<p>In 2019-20, the OCA completed the <a href="/Eng/wn-qn/Pages/OCA_RCMP_2019.aspx"><em>Actuarial Report on the Pension Plan for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police as at 31 March 2018</em></a>, which was tabled in Parliament on December 12, 2019. The report provides actuarial information to decision makers, parliamentarians and the public, thereby increasing transparency and confidence in Canada’s retirement income system.</p>
<p>In 2019-20, the OCA completed numerous actuarial valuations for the Office of the Comptroller General.  These actuarial valuations are prepared for purposes of reporting and disclosure in the consolidated financial statements of the Government of Canada.</p>
<h3>Actuarial Report on the Employment Insurance Premium Rate</h3>
<p>In 2019-20, the OCA presented to the Canada Employment Insurance Commission the <a href="/Eng/wn-qn/Pages/EI2020.aspx"><em>2020 Actuarial Report on the Employment Insurance Premium Rate</em></a>, which was tabled in Parliament on December 9, 2019. The report provides the forecast breakeven premium rate for the upcoming year and a detailed analysis.</p>
<h3>Special Events, Presentations and Studies</h3>
<p>The impacts of increasing longevity on the sustainability of pension plans attract attention both in Canada and around the world. In January 2020, the OCA published the <a href="/Eng/wn-qn/Pages/oas_mfs_2020.aspx"><em>Old Age Security Mortality Fact Sheet</em></a>, which noted that increases in life expectancy were relatively stable between 2004 and 2013 but between 2014 and 2018 there had been a recent slowing trend in the pace of these increases.</p>

</div>
<p>In 2019-20, the OCA published a <a href="/Eng/wn-qn/Pages/rpp_rpa_2019.aspx">fact sheet on Registered Pension Plans (RPP) and Other Types of Savings Plans</a> in Canada. It showed that the number of active RPP members has increased over the last 10 years, with the number of women increasing faster than number of men. Despite this, the number of active RPP members as a percentage of the labour force and as a percentage of employees has slightly decreased. The proportion of active RPP members in defined benefit plans has decreased over the last ten years due to a significant decrease in defined benefit coverage in the private sector.</p>
<p>In 2019-20, the Chief Actuary and OCA staff continued to discuss topics of longevity at national and international events and participated in the work of professional actuarial groups dealing with this issue.</p>

	</ul>
</div>
<p>In 2019-20, we communicated information about our plans, programs and activities to Canadians through our website, traditional and social media, public events, speeches and parliamentary appearances. The Executive Committee and senior officials delivered a number of presentations and remarks across Canada and internationally and OSFI officials are frequently invited to speak at conferences and seminars.</p>
<p>We published our external newsletter <em>The OSFI Pillar</em> in <a href="/Eng/wn-qn/Pages/pl201905.aspx">May 2019</a> and <a href="/Eng/wn-qn/Pages/pl1911.aspx">January 2020</a>. It provides updates and reminders on the latest guidelines, industry notices, public statements and other pertinent information, including feature articles and speeches.</p>
<p>We planned and organized 26 events during the year, ranging from annual risk management seminars and information sessions for financial institutions to industry meetings and workshops as well as international working group meetings.</p>
<p>We responded to more than 6,000 correspondence and telephone inquiries and requests for information, including 102 inquiries from members of Parliament; 182 from news media; 39 access to information requests, and 52 access to information consultations from government departments or other governments.</p>
<h3>Human Resources</h3>
<p>As of March 31, 2020, OSFI employed some 860 people in offices located in Ottawa, Montréal, Toronto and Vancouver. Our employees have a range of skills and experience in financial services, regulatory affairs, risk management and a variety of corporate services.</p>
<p>The leadership team believes in investing in its human capital. To this end, in 2017, we launched a multi-year human capital strategy that sets out a framework for how we manage and develop our people. The strategy consists of five priority areas: leadership development; talent management; learning and development; culture and community; and enterprise change management. In 2019-20, activities we undertook to advance the goals in our strategy included:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The design and development of a talent management program for the non-executive group of employees, and the launch of several pilots of the process and its supporting tools.</li>
	<li>An enhanced onboarding program to support the integration of new employees.</li>
	<li>A new management essentials program to provide training and support to people leaders.</li>
	<li>A comprehensive suite of coaching services, both in-house and through external parties, aimed at building a coaching culture.</li>
	<li>Continued investments to promote and support employee wellness, and diversity and inclusion. The Inclusion Network held many events, activities and awareness campaigns to celebrate diversity in such streams as accessibility, diversity of thought, family responsibilities, gender, invisible differences, LGBTQI2S, mental health, multiculturalism and unconscious bias.</li>
	<li>The refresh of our corporate values and the completion of an organizational culture assessment.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Emergency Preparedness</h3>
<p>Since September 2018, we have actively worked on our Incident Response Protocol and emergency preparedness. In 2019-20, this work included creating and implementing an emergency governance approach, finalising a crisis communications playbook, as well as creating a message centre to increase the speed of emergency broadcasts to employees. This preparedness greatly enhanced our ability to move efficiently and effectively to remote working in March 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic was declared.</p>
<h3>Information Management and Technology</h3>
<p>We developed a new strategy in 2019-20 to provide a long-term plan for the continued evolution of the group’s people and our processes and technology investments. It serves as an umbrella strategy for more specific blueprints that will guide the modernization of our internal operations and evolution to digital services.</p>
<p>Specific highlights include a refresh of our computer fleet; infrastructure, application and network upgrades in all four offices; the introduction of Skype for Business; a cloud adoption roadmap with pilot projects; and successful delivery of the first release of Vu, which is a supervisory case management system using an agile project methodology.</p>
<p>Other achievements:</p>
<ul>
	<li>delivery of an enterprise system for supervisory activity</li>
	<li>new collaboration and data analytics capabilities</li>
	<li>multiple foundational technology refresh initiatives</li>
	<li>a cyber security awareness program</li>
	<li>implementation of new legislative requirements for information management and cloud computing</li>
</ul>
<p>The continued rollout of Skype for Business, user training and significant improvements to the core network capacity (bandwidth) enabled all staff to transition to a full-time work from home scenario with only minor impacts to overall productivity during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h2>OSFI’S 2019-20 FINANCIAL REVIEW AND HIGHLIGHTS</h2>
<p>We are funded mainly through assessments on the financial institutions and private pension plans we regulate and a user-pay program for legislative approvals and other select services.</p>
<p>The amount charged to individual institutions is set out in regulations for our main activities:</p>
<ul>
	<li>risk assessment and intervention (supervision);</li>
	<li>approvals and precedents; and</li>
	<li>regulation and guidance.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, the our system is designed to allocate costs based on the approximate amount of time spent supervising and regulating each industry. Costs are then assessed to individual institutions based on the applicable formula for the industry and the size of the institution.  Staged institutions are assessed a surcharge on their base assessment, approximating the extra supervision resources required. As a result, well-managed, lower-risk institutions bear a smaller share of our costs.</p>
<div class="pull-left" style="border: 1px solid black">
	<p>In addition to yearly reporting of our financial statements through this report, we report our <a href="/Eng/osfi-bsif/rep-rap/qfr-rft/Pages/default.aspx">financial statements quarterly</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>We also receive revenues for cost-recovered services. These include revenues from provinces when we provide supervision services of their institutions on contract, federal Crown corporations such as the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), which we supervise under the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-11/" rel="external"><em>National Housing Act</em></a>, and revenues from other federal organizations to which we provide administrative services.</p>
<p>We collect administrative monetary penalties from financial institutions when they contravene a provision of a <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/o-2.7/fulltext.html" rel="external"><em>Financial Institutions Act</em></a> and are charged in accordance with the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2005-267/index.html" rel="external">Administrative Monetary Penalties (OSFI) Regulations</a>. These penalties are collected and remitted to the consolidated revenue fund. By regulation, these funds cannot be used to reduce the overall assessment costs for the industry.</p>
<p>The Office of the Chief Actuary is funded by fees charged for actuarial valuation and advisory services relating to the Canada Pension Plan, the Old Age Security program, the Canada Student Loans Program and various public sector pension and insurance plans, and by a parliamentary appropriation.</p>
<h3>2019-20 Financial Overview</h3>
<p>Overall, we have fully recovered all costs for the fiscal year 2019-2020.  Our financial statements for the 2019-2020 fiscal year can be found in Annex A.</p>
<p>Our total costs were $189.8 million, a $19.4 million or 11.4% increase from the previous year.  Personnel costs, OSFI’s largest expense, rose by $13.8 million, or 10.7%. The rise is a result of an increase in the average number of full-time equivalent employees, normal economic and merit increases to basic salaries, the impact of a recently signed new collective agreement. Additionally, these costs also include those related to an agreement reached between the Government of Canada and core public administration bargaining agents for damages caused by the Phoenix pay system.</p>
<p>Professional services costs rose by $2.1 million or 13.5%, largely due to an increase in Information Management/Technology consulting costs in support of Project Vu.  Rental costs increased by $1.4 million or 11.6% due to an increase in software license costs due to both additional software and additional users, increased rent on the renewal of some leases. All other costs, in total, increased by $1.9 million or 5.0% to support increased staffing levels.</p>
<p>Our full-time equivalent employees in 2019-20 was 793, a 7.0% increase from the previous year because of the addition of new positions to increase capacity in all sectors of the organization, and the filling of a number of vacant positions.</p>
<h3>Federally Regulated Financial Institutions</h3>
<h4>Revenues</h4>
<p>Total revenues from federally regulated financial institutions were $173.4 million, an increase of $18.7 million or 12.1% from the previous year. Base assessments on financial institutions are recorded at an amount necessary to balance revenue and expenses after all other sources of revenue are taken into account, increased by $19.6 million or 13.1% from the previous year.</p>
<p>Revenue from user fees and charges decreased by $0.3 million or 11.3% because of decreases in the volume of approvals-related work that attracts a user fee and in surcharge assessments.</p>
<h4>Costs</h4>
<p>Total costs attributed to federally regulated financial institutions were $173.7 million, an increase of $19.0 million or 12.3% from the previous year. The increase is primarily due to higher personnel costs ($13.5 million), higher professional services costs ($2.0 million), and higher rental costs ($1.3 million), as explained above.</p>
<h4>Base Assessments by Industry</h4>
<p>Base assessments are the costs allocated to an industry, less user fees and charges and cost-recovered services revenues. Base assessments are differentiated to reflect the share of our costs allocated to each industry group. The chart below compares the cumulative growth of base assessments by industry group over the past five years, using 2014-15 as the base year.</p>
<img src="#" alt="#">
<details><summary>Text Version</summary>
</details>
<p>Overall, the increase in average full-time equivalent employees because of the addition of new positions and filling a number of vacant positions from 2016-17 through 2019-20 contributed to overall growth in assessments.  In 2018-19, investments to implement a comprehensive human capital strategy; modernize our supervisory processes, practices and tools; and execute a cyber-security strategy and its associated action plan also increased base assessments across all industries.  In 2019-20, we made investments in additional employees, supervisory tools and supporting resources to implement our Strategic Plan.</p>
<p>Base assessments on the <strong>deposit-taking institutions</strong> (DTI) industry increased slightly in 2015-16 despite a slight decrease in our total expenses, due to a reduction in surcharge assessments. They rose in 2016-17 through to 2019-20 because of the increases in our total expenses. The rate of growth in 2017-18 was higher in this industry because of increased resources dedicated to supervision in this sector driven by ongoing strengthening of the supervisory regime and increased supervisory activity related primarily to the revised mortgage underwriting guideline B-20. In 2018-19 and 2019-20, the rate of growth in the DTI industry continued to outpace that of the other industries due to increased time spent on mortgage underwriting, the domestic stability buffer (DSB) and small and medium-sized banks. Supervisory capacity also increased in areas such as non-financial risks within this sector.</p>
<p>In 2015-16, base assessments the life insurance industry, decreased in line with our total expenses. It rose in 2016-2017 because of the increase in our total expenses, albeit at a lower rate than that for the DTI and P&amp;C industries because resources allocated to the life industry remained unchanged from the previous year.  In 2017-18, base assessments decreased slightly due to a lower utilization of shared regulatory resources for life insurance matters due to the completion of the new Life Insurance Capital Adequacy Test Guideline (LICAT) in prior years. Base assessments rose again in 2018-19 and 2019-20 because of the increase in our total expenses to support the implementation of its new three-year Strategic Plan. The rate of growth in base assessments is lower than that for the DTI and P&amp;C industries because resources allocated to the life insurance industry remained relatively unchanged from the prior years.</p>
<p>In 2015-16, base assessments on the <strong>property and casualty</strong> (P&amp;C) insurance industry (which includes Mortgage Insurers) increased slightly, despite a decrease in our total expenses, due to a reduction in surcharge assessments.  P&amp;C base assessments rose in 2016-17 through to 2019-20 in line with the increase in our total expenses.</p>
<h3>Federally Regulated Private Pension Plans</h3>
<h4>Assessments</h4>
<p>Our costs to regulate and supervise private pension plans are recovered from an annual assessment charged to plans based on their number of beneficiaries. Plans are assessed upon applying for registration under the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/p-7.01/" rel="external"><em>Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985</em></a>  (PBSA) and annually thereafter.</p>
<p>The assessment rate is established based on our estimate of current year costs to supervise these plans, adjusted for any excess or shortfall of assessments in the preceding years. The estimate is then divided by the anticipated number of assessable beneficiaries to arrive at the  base fee rate. The rate established for 2019-20 was $9.00 per assessable beneficiary, unchanged from the previous year. Total fees assessed during the fiscal year were $6.3 million, up from $5.6 million in 2018-19. Total fees recognized as revenue in 2019-20 were $6.6 million.  The difference between revenue recognized and fees assessed of $0.3 million is the drawdown of excess assessments from prior years, as discussed below.</p>
<p>The excess or shortfall of assessments in any particular year is amortized over five years in accordance with the assessment formula set out in regulations. It stipulates that the annual shortfall or excess is recovered or returned to the pension plans over a period of five years commencing one year from the year in which they were established through an adjustment to the annual fee rate. Prior to 2009-10, rates had been set to recover an accumulated shortfall. A small surplus position was re-established in 2008-09 and continued to rise through 2011-12 as expenses were lower than planned each year.  Since 2012-13, rates have been set to gradually draw the surplus down. The rate established and published in the Canada Gazette in September 2019 for 2020-21 is set at $10.00 per assessable beneficiary, up from $9.00 from 2019-20.  We anticipate that the rate for 2020-21 will fully recover the estimated annual costs of this program; however, variations between actual and estimated costs or plan beneficiaries in any particular year will cause an excess or shortfall of assessments.</p>
<h4>Costs</h4>
<p>The cost of administering the PBSA for 2019-20 was $6.6 million, a decrease of $0.1 million or 0.3% from the previous year due to a reduction in the usage of legal services from the Department of Justice.</p>

<h3>Office of the Chief Actuary</h3>
<h4>Actuarial Valuation and Advisory Services</h4>
<p>The OCA is funded by fees charged for actuarial valuation and advisory services and by an annual parliamentary appropriation. Total expenses in 2019-20 were $9.4 million, an increase of $0.4 million, or 5.0%, from the previous year primarily due to higher personnel costs a result of the staffing of vacancies, normal economic and merit increases to basic salaries and an increase in professional services and software costs related to specialized actuarial software.</p>
