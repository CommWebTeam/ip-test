      <h1>Regulation and Guidance</h1>
      <p>OSFI provides a regulatory framework of guidance and rules for federally regulated financial institutions that reflect international minimum standards. OSFI also provides input to the development of federal legislation and regulations affecting regulated financial entities. It comments on accounting, auditing and actuarial standards development, including determining how to incorporate those standards into its regulatory framework. OSFI also participates in a number of international and domestic rule-making activities and groups. </p>
      <h2>Accounting, Auditing and Actuarial Standards</h2>
      <p>OSFI's supervision and regulation of financial institutions places strong reliance on the quality of audited financial statements. For this reason, OSFI actively participates in several domestic and international standard-setting and oversight bodies related to Canadian auditing and accounting standards:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Basel Committee's Accounting Experts Group, which develops high-quality international accounting, audit and ethics standards and practices for banks</li>
        <li>Canadian Accounting Standards Board's (AcSB) Insurance Transition Resource Group, which provide the AcSB with user and implementation insights</li>
        <li>Auditing and Assurance Standards Oversight Council (AASOC), which oversees the activities of the Canadian Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (AASB) </li>
        <li>Accounting Standards Oversight Committee (AcSOC), which oversees the activities of the AcSB and the Public Sector Accounting Board (PSAB)</li>
        <li>Canadian Public Accountability Board (CPAB) Council of Governors, which conducts an annual high-level assessment of the CPAB against its mandate</li>
        <li>Public Interest Oversight Board (PIOB), which oversees the international standard-setting of auditing, ethics and education standards</li>
      </ul>
      <p>OSFI works closely with the <a href="https://www.cia-ica.ca/home" rel="external">Canadian Institute of Actuaries (CIA)</a> and the <a href="http://www.asb-cna.ca/" rel="external">Actuarial Standards Board (ASB)</a> toward actuarial standards that are appropriate and lead to acceptable practice in such areas as valuation, and risk and capital assessment at insurance and pension plan entities. In 2018-19, OSFI participated on the CIA IFRS 17 steering committee; several CIA standards and guidance committees; the CIA/ASB group on the harmonization of dynamic capital adequacy testing (DCAT) with insurance companies' Own Risk and Solvency Assessments (ORSA); and joined the ASB designated group updating actuarial standards related to the implementation of IFRS 17. </p>
      <h2>Capital and Liquidity Guidance</h2>
      <h3>Deposit-taking Institutions</h3>

        <div class="img__container--360"> <img src="/Documents/WET5/AR/img/Capital-Liquidity.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive">
          <div class="img__overlay"><strong>MATTHEW GORDON</strong><br/>
            Senior Analyst, Capital Banking, Regulation Sector<br/>

      <p>Following public consultation, OSFI released in October 2018 an updated version of its <a href="/Eng/fi-if/rg-ro/gdn-ort/gl-ld/Pages/CAR19_index.aspx">Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR) guideline</a>. The CAR is the framework within which OSFI assesses the capital adequacy of federally regulated institutions. The main amendments relate to the domestic implementation of the standardized approach to counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR), capital requirements for bank exposures to central counterparties (CCPs) and the securitization framework. </p>
      <p>OSFI updated its <a href="/Eng/fi-if/rg-ro/gdn-ort/gl-ld/Pages/LAR19_index.aspx">Liquidity Adequacy Requirements (LAR) Guideline</a> in April 2019 to include targeted modifications related to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Cumulative Cash Flow (NCCF) metrics. These revisions promote the safety and soundness of federally regulated institutions and allow the metrics to better reflect the increased risks posed by different types of retail deposits that may be subject to sudden withdrawals. The revised LAR guideline also includes final rules to incorporate the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) for domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs). The NSFR is a long-term structural liquidity metric designed to promote funding stability and reduce the likelihood that a disruption to an institution's regular sources of funding will erode its liquidity position in a way that could increase the risk of its failure. The implementation of the NSFR as a regulatory requirement in Q1-2020 reflects changes from the global standard intended to suit the unique characteristics of the Canadian market.</p>
      <p>The Canadian statutory bail-in regime for D-SIBs, including the bail-in regulations and OSFI's final <a href="/Eng/fi-if/rg-ro/gdn-ort/gl-ld/Pages/tlac.aspx">Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)</a> guideline, which sets out requirements for a D-SIB to maintain sufficient loss-absorbing capacity to support its recapitalization in the event of failure, came into force on September 23, 2018. D-SIBs began public disclosure of their TLAC levels in fiscal Q1-2019 and must fully meet their minimum TLAC requirements by November 1, 2021.</p>
      <p>OSFI launched an initiative in 2018-19 focused on improving the <a href="/eng/osfi-bsif/med/Pages/smsb-nr.aspx">proportionality of its capital and liquidity frameworks</a> in their application to non-internationally active small and medium-sized deposit-taking institutions. A discussion paper will seek input from stakeholders and will be used to inform the development of new requirements for these institutions.</p>
      <p>To provide greater market clarity and transparency, OSFI began communicating publicly its <a href="/Eng/fi-if/in-ai/Pages/dsb-idx.aspx">domestic stability buffer (DSB)</a> in June and December. An effective capital regime ensures that banks are holding adequate capital to protect against risks and encourages them to use their buffers during times of stress to avoid unnecessary sales of assets or drastic reductions in lending. The DSB contributes to D-SIBs' resilience to key vulnerabilities and system-wide risks, thereby contributing to financial stability. Increases to the buffer will occur when it would be prudent for a D-SIB to hold additional capital to protect against vulnerabilities. Decreases of the buffer will occur when OSFI identifies that vulnerabilities have diminished or risks have materialized. Decisions on the calibration of the buffer are based on OSFI supervisory judgment, informed by its analytical work on a range of vulnerabilities, and are made in consultation with its federal partners. The DSB was raised from 1.75 percent to 2.00 percent in June 2019. </p>

      <p>In summer 2018, OSFI issued its first version of the <a href="/Eng/fi-if/rg-ro/gdn-ort/gl-ld/Pages/micat.aspx">Mortgage Insurer Capital Adequacy Test (MICAT) guideline</a>, which combined elements of the property and casualty insurance capital framework and the 2017 Advisory: Capital Requirements for Federally Regulated Mortgage Insurers. In fall 2018, OSFI released updated versions of its <a href="/Eng/fi-if/rg-ro/gdn-ort/gl-ld/Pages/LICAT19_index.aspx">Life Insurance Capital Adequacy Test (LICAT)</a> and <a href="/Eng/fi-if/rg-ro/gdn-ort/gl-ld/Pages/mct2019.aspx">Minimum Capital Test (MCT)</a> guidelines for life and property and casualty insurers, respectively. Not only do these updated and new versions incorporate implications of IFRS 16 <em>Leases</em>, they make further refinements and clarifications in respect of inquiries or comments received from insurers and stakeholders.</p>
      <p>In collaboration with the P&amp;C MCT Advisory Committee, OSFI developed a framework for the use of insurer-specific regulatory capital models to determine insurance capital requirements for P&amp;C insurance companies that are not mortgage insurers.</p>
      <p>OSFI also issued an updated version of its <a href="/Eng/fi-if/rg-ro/gdn-ort/gl-ld/Pages/b5-19.aspx">Asset Securitization guideline</a>, which sets out expectations for life and P&amp;C insurers for asset securitization transactions. Key amendments reflect events that have affected securitizations since the guideline was first published in November 2004, including the financial crisis and changes to the Basel framework.</p>
      <p>Finally, in support of a robust implementation of the new accounting standard IFRS 17 <em>Insurance Contracts</em>, OSFI continued to review and consult on the implications of that standard on the LICAT, MICAT and MCT capital frameworks. OSFI communicated its approach to implementing IFRS 17 in the life and P&amp;C capital frameworks in June 2018.</p>
      <h2>Other Guidance</h2>
      <h3>Large Exposure Limits</h3>
      <p>OSFI updated its guidance on <a href="/Eng/fi-if/rg-ro/gdn-ort/gl-ld/Pages/b2-20.aspx">large exposure limits</a> applicable to D-SIBs, releasing a draft version in December 2018 followed by a final version in April 2019. It incorporates the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision guidance to reflect current risk management sound practices and provides additional guidance on methods OSFI expects D-SIBs to use for identifying, measuring, managing and monitoring large exposures. The revised guideline takes effect on November 1, 2019.</p>
      <h3>Interest Rate Risk Management</h3>
      <p>In October 2018, OSFI issued a draft revised version of its <a href="/Eng/fi-if/rg-ro/gdn-ort/gl-ld/Pages/B12.aspx">guideline on the management of interest rate risk</a>. The guideline now incorporates most of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision guidance to reflect changes in the market, the methods institutions should adopt for measuring, managing and monitoring IRRBB and updated supervisory practices. The final version was released in May 2019.</p>
      <h2>Disclosure Guidance</h2>
      <h3>Leverage Ratio Disclosure Requirements</h3>
      <p>In November 2018, OSFI issued an updated version of its <a href="/Eng/fi-if/rg-ro/gdn-ort/gl-ld/Pages/D12.aspx">Leverage Ratio Disclosure Requirements</a> to align with the revisions to the Leverage Requirements and Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR) guidelines that were issued in October 2018. Federally regulated deposit-taking institutions implemented the revised requirements for their fiscal Q1 2019 reporting period.</p>
      <h3>Net Stable Funding Ratio Disclosure Requirements</h3>
      <p>In April 2019, OSFI issued the final version of the <a href="/Eng/fi-if/rg-ro/gdn-ort/gl-ld/Pages/nsfr19.aspx">Net Stable Funding Ratio Disclosure Requirement guideline</a> as a complement to the corresponding chapter on NSFR in the Liquidity Adequacy Requirements guideline. NSFR disclosures provide transparency on regulatory funding requirements for deposit taking institutions. D-SIBs are to implement the revised requirements for their fiscal Q1 2020 reporting period.</p>
      <h3>Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) Disclosure Requirements</h3>
      <p>In May 2018, OSFI issued the final version of its <a href="/Eng/fi-if/rg-ro/gdn-ort/gl-ld/Pages/tlac_disc.aspx">TLAC disclosure requirements guideline</a>. TLAC disclosures provide transparency on the loss absorbing capacity of a D-SIB to support its recapitalization in the event of non-viability. D-SIBs implemented the new TLAC disclosure requirements in their fiscal Q1 2019 reporting period.</p>
