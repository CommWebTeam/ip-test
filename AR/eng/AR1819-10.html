      <h1>Federally Regulated Private Pension Plans</h1>
      <p>OSFI supervises federally regulated private pension plans and protects pension plan members and other beneficiaries by developing guidance on risk management and mitigation, assessing whether private pension plans are meeting their funding requirements and managing risks effectively, and intervening promptly when corrective actions need to be taken. Pension plan administrators are ultimately responsible for sound and prudent management of their plans.</p>
      <p>Approximately seven percent of private pension plans in Canada are federally regulated (Statistics Canada data as at January 2018). As at March 31, 2019, 1,214 private pension plans were registered under the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/p-7.01/index.html" rel="external"><em>Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985 (PBSA)</em></a>, covering more than 1,154,600 active members and other beneficiaries in federally regulated areas of employment such as banking, inter-provincial transportation and telecommunications. Between April 1, 2018, and March 31, 2019, federally regulated private pension plan assets decreased by 1.7 percent, to a value of approximately $215.5 billion (<em><a href="#P10.1">refer to table 1</a></em>).</p>
      <p>Under the federal <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/p-15.3/index.html" rel="external"><em>Pooled Registered Pension Plan Act (PRPP Act)</em></a> and its regulations, OSFI is responsible for licensing PRPP administrators, registering PRPPs and supervising these plans. At the end of 2018, there were five federally registered PRPPs, with one reporting 11 participating employers and 186 members (the total value of investments was $297,224) (<em><a href="#P10.1">refer to table 1</a></em>). </p>

      <p>The overall solvency position of federally regulated pension plans deteriorated in 2018 due to a sharp decrease in investment returns in the final quarter of 2018 that reversed most of the gains achieved in the first nine months of the year. The first quarter of 2019 saw revived equity market returns, which helped offset most of the 2018 end-of-year decline. However, because the valuation date of actuarial reports is generally at the end of the calendar year, the rebound will not affect the funding requirements of defined benefit pension plans for 2019.</p>
      <p>Federal solvency funding requirements for plans with defined benefit provisions are based on a plan's three-year average solvency position, meaning the 2018 solvency ratio replaces the 2015 value in calculating the average. For most plans, the three-year average solvency position has increased slightly despite solvency ratios in 2018 generally being lower than in 2017 because 2018 solvency ratios are generally higher than 2015 ratios. As a result, most plans are not expected to experience an increase in their required solvency funding payments for 2019 compared to 2018.</p>
      <p>The recent market volatility demonstrates how rapidly a pension plan's solvency position can change and many plan sponsors continue to explore ways to manage volatility and pension risks. One such option is the transfer of liabilities from a pension plan to an insurance company through the purchase of annuities. The fourth quarter of 2018 was the most active quarter in Canadian annuity market history, with an estimated $1.5 billion of annuities purchased.</p>

      <h2>Risk Assessment, Supervision and Intervention</h2>
      <p>In 2018-19, three major reviews began: how OSFI supervises investments of pension plans; pension plans with defined contribution (DC) provisions; and data collected on regulatory returns.</p>
      <p>The review of supervision of investments is considering the investment information and data being collected and analyzed as well as the supervisory procedures OSFI follows to ensure that potential risks are appropriately identified. This review will continue in 2019-20 and is intended to strengthen OSFI's principles- and risk-based approaches to pension plan supervision.</p>
      <p>The review of pension plans with DC provisions is intended to enhance OSFI's risk-based approach to supervision by requesting specific information on plan fees, default investment options and the number and type of investment options offered to members. In 2019-20, OSFI will analyze the information and may adjust its supervisory procedures or update external guidance based on the risks identified.</p>
      <p>We reviewed data collected on annual regulatory returns to consider its usefulness and to identify duplication. The data was mapped and summarized and an analysis was performed resulting in decisions to add, remove and streamline data on annual regulatory filings. Some modifications to the returns are expected to be introduced in 2019-20 while other changes will be implemented following the completion of the investment and DC projects described above. </p>
      <h3>Solvency Testing</h3>
		
		<p>OSFI regularly estimates the solvency ratio (the ratio of assets over liabilities on a plan termination basis) for about 360 plans with defined benefit provisions. The Estimated Solvency Ratio (ESR) results help identify (before a plan files its actuarial report) any solvency issues that could affect the security of members' promised pension benefits and broader trends.</p>

      <p>Solvency Position of Pension Plans as at December 31 (past 10 years)</p>

      <p class="graph__caption-text">The liability-weighted average ESR for all pension plans was 0.98 at December 31, 2018, down from 1.02 at the end of 2017. The ESR results indicated that 74 percent of defined benefit plans were underfunded at December 31, 2018, up from 63 percent at the end of 2017. In addition, there has been an increase in the number of plans that are more significantly underfunded (ESRs below 0.80) from 13 percent at the end of 2017 to 16 percent at the end of 2018. </p>  
		</figure>

      <h3>Actuarial Reports</h3>
      <p>OSFI assesses whether private pension plans are meeting funding requirements under the PBSA and expectations set out in guidance. Actuarial reports are reviewed for defined benefit plans and if risks are noted or if the approval of the Superintendent is required, the report is reviewed more in depth, and any concerns are then raised with the plan's actuary. Issues raised provide an opportunity for actuaries to discuss the concerns OSFI has with actuarial reports, which may have an impact on current and future funding requirements.</p>
      <p>Nearly 300 actuarial reports were filed with OSFI in 2018-19, and 62 were reviewed more in depth. OSFI intervention in 2018-19 resulted in some plans being required to amend and re-submit their actuarial report or in some cases, to file their subsequent actuarial report early. </p>
      <h3>Examinations</h3>
      <p>As part of its risk-based supervisory approach, OSFI conducts examinations of select plans. During 2018-19, six examinations were performed: two defined benefit plans; two defined contribution plans; and two combination plans (having both defined benefit and defined contribution provisions). The examinations may be limited to a desk review or may be conducted on the plan administrator's premises.</p>
      <h3>Watch List</h3>
      <p>Pension plans facing higher risk due to their financial condition, plan management or other reasons, are placed on a watch list and actively monitored. At March 31, 2019, 26 plans were on the watch list, a decrease from 37 the year before. Of the 26 plans on the watch list, 19 were defined benefit and seven were defined contribution plans. During 2018-19, five new plans were added to the watch list and 16 plans were removed.</p>
      <h2>Rules and Guidance</h2>
      <p>Regulations Amending the Assessment of Pension Plans Regulations: These amendments streamline the annual assessment process for plan administrators and OSFI and eliminate annual assessments for certain terminated pension plans where annual assessments of these plans was not considered appropriate. The regulations are made under the <em>OSFI Act</em> and came into force on April 1, 2019.</p>
      <p>Guidance: To enhance its accountability to external stakeholders, OSFI regularly reviews and updates existing guidance and issues new guidance when warranted. In August 2018, OSFI issued a revised instruction guide for a refund of surplus to the employer. The revisions mainly clarified OSFI's expectations for the process of making an application to the Superintendent for consent to a refund of surplus to the employer.</p>
      <p>In June 2018, OSFI issued five PRPP member guides for members of federally registered PRPPs that describe the general requirements as well the various requirements impacting individual benefits for federal, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Ontario and Nova Scotia members. A guide for Manitoba members will follow. Under the <em>Multilateral Agreement Respecting Pooled Registered Pension Plans and Voluntary Retirement Savings Plans</em>, OSFI is responsible for supervising multijurisdictional PRPPs that are federally registered and contain members covered by legislation of the provinces that are party to the agreement, with the exception of Quebec.</p>
      <p>In May 2018, OSFI issued revisions to its instruction guide for completing certified financial statements and submitting an auditor's report. The revisions included changes to the guide and accompanying form to ensure consistency with the Regulatory Reporting System (RRS) and clarity regarding filing requirements </p>
      <h2>InfoPensions</h2>
      <p>OSFI published its newsletter, <a href="/Eng/pp-rr/ppa-rra/ifp/Pages/default.aspx"><em>InfoPensions</em></a> in May and November 2018.It includes announcements and reminders for plan administrators, pension advisors and other stakeholders as well as descriptions of how OSFI applies provisions of the pension legislation and its guidance.</p>
      
      <h2>Pension Approvals</h2>
      <p>Federally regulated private pension plans are required to seek approval from the Superintendent for several types of transactions: plan registrations and terminations; asset transfers between registered defined benefit pension plans; refunds of surplus; and reductions of accrued benefits. The number of pension transactions submitted to the Superintendent for approval increased to 63 in 2018-19 from 37 in 2017-18. OSFI processed 47 applications for approval in 2018-19, compared to 54 the previous year.</p>
      <p>In 2018-19, 14 new plans were registered (two defined benefit and 12 defined contribution), while 16 plan termination reports were approved (five defined benefit and 11 defined contribution).</p>
      <p>In response to feedback from a 2017 survey, OSFI reviewed its procedures for approving pension plan transactions to ensure that approvals are processed efficiently.</p>
