      <h1>Office of the Chief Actuary</h1>
      <p>The <a href="/Eng/oca-bac/Pages/default.aspx">Office of the Chief Actuary (OCA)</a> contributes to a financially sound and sustainable Canadian public retirement income system by providing expert actuarial services to the Government of Canada and to provincial governments that are Canada Pension Plan (CPP) stakeholders.</p>
      <p>The OCA provides actuarial valuation and advisory services for the CPP, the Old Age Security (OAS) program, the Canada Student Loans Program and the Employment Insurance program, as well as for pension and benefits plans covering the federal public service, the Canadian Forces, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, federally appointed judges and members of Parliament.</p>
      <p>The OCA is established within OSFI as an independent unit. The fact that it is hosted by OSFI ensures its independence and impartiality. Although the Chief Actuary reports to the Superintendent, the accountability framework of the OCA makes it clear that its staff is solely responsible for actuarial advice provided.</p>

      <p>On March 5, 2019, Jeremy Rudin announced the appointment of <a href="/Eng/oca-bac/Pages/bio.aspx">Assia Billig</a> as Chief Actuary and head of the OCA. Ms. Billig will succeed Jean-Claude Ménard, who will retire in April 2019 after twenty years of service as Chief Actuary.</p>
      <p>Ms. Billig joined the OCA in 2008, where she was involved in the preparation of statutory actuarial reports on the CPP and OAS as well as of various national and international actuarial studies. Prior to joining the OCA, she worked in private pension consulting.</p>
      <p>Ms. Billig is recognized around the world as an expert on actuarial aspects of social security programs. She is the vice-chair of the International Actuarial Association Social Security Committee and the chair of the Technical Commission on Statistical, Actuarial and Financial Studies of the International Social Security Association. She is the author or co-author of several articles, many of which can be found in <em>International Social Security Review</em> and on OSFI's web site.</p>
      <p>Ms. Billig is a Fellow of the Society of Actuaries and the Canadian Institute of Actuaries. She has completed her undergraduate studies in Moscow State University and has a PhD in Mathematics from the University of Alberta. </p>

          <h2>Tabling of the 29<sup>th</sup> Actuarial Report Supplementing the 27<sup>th</sup> and 28<sup>th</sup> Actuarial Reports on the Canada Pension Plan</h2>
          <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-12 img--right">
            <div class="img__container--360"><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="/Documents/WET5/AR/img/Actuarial-Report-Cover_eng.png"> </div>
          </div>
          <p>Division 19 of Part 6 of Bill C-74, the <em>Budget Implementation Act, 2018, No. 1 </em>(Bill C-74) introduced proposed amendments to the base and additional components of the CPP. In addition to introducing child-rearing and disability drop-in provisions to the additional CPP, the proposed amendments enhance the survivor benefits under both the base and additional CPP as well as the disability and death benefits under the base CPP. The 29<sup>th</sup> Actuarial Report supplementing the 27<sup>th</sup> and 28<sup>th</sup> Actuarial Reports on the Canada Pension Plan as at 31 December 2015 was prepared to show the effect of Bill C-74 on the long-term financial state of the base and additional CPP.</p>
          <p>The report, which was tabled in Parliament on May 1, 2018, provides the long-term projected impact of these amendments on the number of beneficiaries and the benefit expenditures. It also presents long-term financial projections to support the report's conclusion that if the amendments are implemented, the legislated contribution rates of both the base CPP and the additional CPP result in projected contributions and investment income that are sufficient to fully pay for the projected expenditures over the long term. Under the proposed amendments and current legislated contribution rates, the base CPP assets and additional CPP assets are projected to reach $1,442 billion and $1,322 billion respectively by 2050.</p>

      <h2>Public Sector Insurance and Pension Plans</h2>
      <p>In 2018-19, the OCA completed two actuarial reports on public sector insurance and pension plans, which were submitted to the President of the Treasury Board for tabling in Parliament. The <em>Actuarial Report on the Pension Plan for the Public Service of Canada as at 31 March 2017</em> and the <em>Actuarial Report on the Public Service Death Benefit Account as at 31 March 2017</em> were tabled in Parliament on November 2, 2018.</p>
      <p>These reports provide actuarial information to decision makers, parliamentarians and the public, thereby increasing transparency and confidence in Canada's retirement income system.</p>
      <h3>Actuarial Report on the Employment Insurance Premium Rate</h3>
      <p>In 2018-19, the OCA presented to the Canada Employment Insurance Commission the <em>2019 Actuarial Report on the Employment Insurance Premium Rate</em>, which was tabled in Parliament on September 27, 2018. The report provides the forecast break-even premium rate for the upcoming year and a detailed analysis.</p>
      <h3>Actuarial Report on the Canada Student Loans Program</h3>
      <p>In 2018-19, the OCA submitted to the Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Labour the <em>Actuarial Report on the Canada Student Loans Program as at July 31, 2017</em>. The report, which was tabled in Parliament on July 18, 2018, presents a valuation of the program's overall financial costs and increases the level of information available to decision makers, parliamentarians and the public.</p>
      <h3>Special Events, Presentations and Special Studies</h3>
      <p>In 2018-19, the OCA released <em>Actuarial Study No.19:</em> <em>Measuring and Reporting Actuarial Obligations of the Canada Pension Plan </em>and<em> Actuarial Study No.20: Technical Paper on the Additional Canada Pension Plan Regulations. </em>Actuarial Study No.19 discusses different methodologies used to produce a social security pension system's balance sheet. It concludes that if the CPP financial sustainability is to be measured using a balance sheet approach, it should be done on an open-group basis that reflects the partially funded nature of the CPP. Actuarial Study No. 20 provides technical information on the methodology for calculating the contribution rates of the additional CPP as prescribed in <em>Calculation of Contribution Rates Regulations, 2018</em>. It also discusses the design of the <em>Additional Canada Pension Plan Sustainability Regulations</em>, which provide a mechanism for adjusting additional CPP benefits and/or contributions under specific sets of circumstances. In its conclusion, the study highlights that the design of the sustainability regulations shares adjustments between current beneficiaries, contributors and their employers. It aims at minimizing intergenerational transfers to be consistent with the design and financing objectives of the additional CPP, and provides to all generations of Canadians the confidence of being treated fairly.</p>
      <p>The impacts of increasing longevity on the sustainability of pension plans attract attention both in Canada and around the world. The OCA published the <em>Old Age Security Mortality Fact Sheet,</em> which noted that despite continued increases in life expectancies for OAS beneficiaries between 2000 and 2017, there has been a decreasing trend in the annual mortality improvement rates for all age groups.</p>
      <p>In 2018-19, the Chief Actuary and OCA staff continued to discuss topics of longevity at national and international events and participated in the work of professional actuarial groups dealing with this matter. A number of presentations were also given by OCA employees throughout the year covering a wide variety of topics such as the funding risks for federal public sector pension plans, the sustainability of the CPP and design considerations of multi-pillar pension systems in Canada and abroad.</p>
