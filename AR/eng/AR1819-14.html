      <h1>Financial Review and Highlights</h1>
		<p>OSFI recovers its costs from several  revenue sources. OSFI is funded mainly through assessments on the financial  institutions and private pension plans that it regulates and supervises, and a  user-pay program for legislative approvals and other selected services.</p>
		<p>The amount charged to individual  institutions for OSFI’s main activities of risk assessment and intervention  (supervision), approvals and precedents, and regulation and guidance is  determined in several ways, according to formulas set out in regulations. In  general, the system is designed to allocate costs based on the approximate  amount of time spent supervising and regulating each industry. Costs are then  assessed to individual institutions within an industry based on the applicable  formula, with a minimum assessment for smaller institutions. </p>
		<p>Staged institutions are assessed a  surcharge on their base assessment, approximating the extra supervision  resources required. As a result, well-managed, lower-risk institutions bear a  smaller share of OSFI’s costs. </p>
		<p>OSFI also receives revenues for cost-recovered services. These include revenues  from provinces for which OSFI provides supervision of their  institutions on contract, federal Crown corporations such as the Canada  Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), which OSFI supervises under the <em>National Housing Act,</em> and revenues from  other federal organizations to which OSFI provides administrative services. </p>
		<p>OSFI collects administrative monetary penalties  from financial institutions when they contravene a provision of a financial  institutions Act and are charged in accordance with the <em>Administrative Monetary Penalties (OSFI) Regulations</em>. These  penalties are collected and remitted to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. By  regulation, OSFI cannot use these funds to reduce the amount that it assesses  the industry in respect of its operating costs.</p>
		<p>The Office of the Chief Actuary (OCA)  is funded by fees charged for actuarial valuation and advisory services relating  to the Canada Pension Plan, the Old Age Security program, the Canada Student  Loans Program and various public sector pension and insurance plans, and by a  parliamentary appropriation. </p>
		<p>Overall, OSFI fully recovered all its  costs for the fiscal year 2018-2019.</p>
		<p>OSFI’s total costs were $170.4 million,  a $13.1 million or 8.3% increase from the previous year.&#160; Personnel costs, OSFI’s largest expense, rose  by $11.3 million, or 9.6%. The increase is a result of normal economic and  merit increases to basic salaries, a decision to match the broader federal  public service economic adjustment to salaries retroactive to 2015 for the  executive group of employees, and an increase in the average number of  full-time equivalent employees. Professional services costs rose by $1.2  million or 8.0%, largely due to an increase in Information  Management/Technology consulting costs in support of a multi-year technology  project that commenced in 2018 to modernize OSFI’s supervisory processes,  practices and tools. All other costs, in total, increased by $0.6 million or 1.6%.</p>
		<p>OSFI’s average number of full-time equivalent employees  in 2018-2019 was 741, a 6.6% increase from the previous year because of the  addition of new positions to increase capacity in all sectors of the  organization, and the filling of a number of vacant positions.</p>
		<h2>Federally Regulated Financial  Institutions </h2>
		<h3>Revenues </h3>
		<p>Total revenues from federally regulated  financial institutions were $154.7 million, an increase of $12.8 million or 9.0%  from the previous year. Base assessments on financial institutions, which are  recorded at an amount necessary to balance revenue and expenses after all other  sources of revenue are taken into account, increased by $12.7 million or 9.3%  from the previous year.</p>
		<p>Revenue from user fees and charges increased  by $0.6 million or 31.7% because of increases in the volume of approvals-related  work that attracts a user fee and in surcharge assessments.</p>
		<h3>Costs </h3>
		<p>Total costs attributed to federally  regulated financial institutions were $154.7 million, an increase of $12.8  million or 9.0% from the previous year. The increase is primarily due to higher  personnel costs ($11.1 million) and higher professional services costs ($1.4  million), as explained above.&#160; </p>
		<h3>Base Assessments by Industry </h3>
		<p>Base assessments are differentiated to  reflect the share of OSFI’s costs allocated to each industry group (base  assessments are the costs allocated to an industry, less user fees and charges  and cost-recovered services revenues). The chart below compares the cumulative  growth of base assessments by industry group over the past five years, using 2013-2014  as the base year. </p>
		<div class="box-border col-md-12">
			<img id="FinReview_chart1" class="img-responsive" alt="Chart of the cumulative growth of base assessments by industry group over the past five years, using 2013-2014 as the base year" src="/Documents/WET5/AR/img/FinReview_chart1.png"/>
		</div>
		<p>Base assessments on the  deposit-taking institutions (DTI) industry increased in 2014-2015 in line with OSFI’s total expenses. In  2015-2016, base assessments increased slightly, despite a decrease in OSFI’s  total expenses, due to a reduction in surcharge assessments. Base assessments rose  in 2016-2017 through to 2018-2019 because of the increases in OSFI’s total  expenses. The rate of growth in 2017-2018 was higher in this industry because  of a review of the sales practices of D-SIBs and increased  supervisory activity related primarily to the revised mortgage underwriting  guideline B-20. In 2018-2019, the rate of growth in the DTI industry continued  to outpace that of the other industries due to increased time spent on mortgage  underwriting, the domestic stability buffer and small and medium-sized banks. </p>
		 <p>The increase in assessments on the  property and casualty (P&amp;C) insurance industry in 2014-2015 was consistent  with the growth in OSFI’s total expenses. In 2015-2016, base assessments  increased slightly, despite a decrease in OSFI’s total expenses, due to a  reduction in surcharge assessments. Base assessments rose in 2016-2017 through to  2018-2019 in line with the increase in OSFI’s total expenses.</p>
		<p>The increase in assessments on the life insurance  industry in 2014-2015 reflected the addition of staff with specific expertise  in life insurance, OSFI’s efforts in developing a new framework for the  standardized Minimum Continuing Capital and Surplus Requirements (MCCSR)  approach, and continued work on the development of a new Life Insurance  Solvency Framework Standard Approach (that was released in 2017-2018). In  2015-2016, base assessments decreased in line with OSFI’s total expenses. Base  assessments rose in 2016-2017 as a result of the increase in OSFI’s  total expenses, albeit at a lower rate than that for the DTI and P&amp;C  industries because resources allocated to the life industry remained unchanged  from the previous year. In 2017-2018, base assessments decreased slightly due  to a lower utilization of shared regulatory resources for life insurance matters  as a result of the completion of the new Life Insurance Capital Adequacy Test  Guideline (LICAT). Base assessments rose in 2018-2019  because of the  increase in OSFI’s total expenses. Consistent with the last several years, the  rate of growth in base assessments is lower than that for the DTI and P&amp;C  industries because resources allocated to the life insurance industry remained relatively  unchanged from the previous year.</p>
		 <p>In addition to these industry-specific cost drivers, the  increase in average full-time equivalent employees as a result of the addition  of new positions and filling a number of vacant positions during 2016-2017 through  2018-2019 contributed to overall growth in assessments. In 2018-2019, investments  to implement a comprehensive human capital strategy, modernize OSFI’s  supervisory processes, practices and tools, and execute a cyber security  strategy and its associated action plan also increased base assessments across  all industries.</p>
		<h2>Federally Regulated Private Pension  Plans </h2>
		<h3>Assessments </h3>
		<p>OSFI’s costs to regulate and supervise  private pension plans are recovered from an annual assessment charged to plans  based on their number of beneficiaries. Plans are assessed upon applying for  registration under the <em>Pension Benefits Standards Act</em>, <em>1985</em> (PBSA) and annually thereafter.</p>
		<p>The assessment rate is established  based on OSFI’s estimate of current year costs to supervise these plans,  adjusted for any excess or shortfall of assessments in the preceding years. The  estimate is then divided by the anticipated number of assessable beneficiaries to  arrive at a base fee rate. The rate established for 2018-2019 was $8.00 per  assessable beneficiary, unchanged from the previous year. Total fees assessed  during the fiscal year were $5.6 million, also unchanged from 2017-2018. Total  fees recognized as revenue in 2018-2019 were $6.7 million.&#160; The difference between revenue recognized and  fees assessed of $1.1 million is the drawdown of excess assessments from prior  years, as discussed below.</p>
		<p>The excess or shortfall of assessments in any  particular year is amortized over five years in accordance with the assessment  formula set out in regulations whereby the annual shortfall or excess is  recovered or returned to the pension plans over a period of five years commencing  one year from the year in which they were established through an adjustment to  the annual fee rate. Prior to 2009-2010, rates had been set to recover an  accumulated shortfall. A small surplus position was re-established in 2008-2009  and continued to rise through 2011-2012 as expenses were lower than planned  each year. Since 2012-2013, rates have been set to gradually draw the surplus  down. The rate established and published in the <em>Canada Gazette</em> in  September 2018 for 2019-2020 is set at $9.00 per assessable beneficiary, up  from $8.00 from 2018-2019. OSFI anticipates that the rate for 2019-2020 will fully  recover the estimated annual costs of this program; however, variations between  actual and estimated costs or plan beneficiaries in any particular year will cause  an excess or shortfall of assessments. </p>
		<h3>Costs </h3>
		<p>The cost of administering the PBSA for  2018-2019 was $6.7 million, a decrease of $0.5 million or 7.4% from the  previous year due to a reduction in amortization expense as certain assets  became fully amortized, and a reduction in usage of legal services from the  Department of Justice.&#160; </p>
