      <h1>Financial Institution Approvals</h1>
      <p>The <em>Bank Act, Trust and Loan Companies Act, Insurance Companies Act</em>, and <em>Cooperative Credit Associations Act</em><sup id="fn1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup> require federally regulated financial institutions to seek regulatory approval from the Superintendent or the Minister of Finance (after receiving the recommendation of the Superintendent) prior to engaging in certain transactions or business undertakings.</p>
      <p>Regulatory approvals are also required by persons wishing to incorporate an institution, and by foreign banks or foreign insurance companies wishing to establish a presence or to make certain investments in Canada. OSFI administers a regulatory approval process that is prudentially effective, responsive and transparent. OSFI's Approvals Unit is responsible for making recommendations to the Superintendent, and to the Minister of Finance, for matters requiring regulatory approval.</p>
      <p>In 2018-19, OSFI processed 172 applications, of which 158 were approved and fourteen were withdrawn. Individual applications often contain multiple approval requests. The 158 approved applications involved 318 individual approvals, 231 of which were granted by the Superintendent and 87 by the Minister. The number of applications remained relatively flat from the previous fiscal year, when 154 applications were approved. The majority of approved applications for 2018-19 related to banks (40%) and P&amp;C insurers (37%).</p>

            <p class="graph__caption-text">The most common applications received from deposit-taking institutions related to purchases or redemptions of shares or debentures, substantial investments, and changes in ownership. For insurance companies, the most common applications related to reinsurance with related unregistered reinsurers, purchases or redemptions of shares or debentures, and amending orders to commence and carry on business or insure in-Canada risks.</p>

      <p>During 2018-19, letters patent were granted incorporating Equitable Trust as a trust company, and Motus Bank as a domestic bank. Letters patent were also granted continuing Haventree Bank, previously a federal trust company, as a domestic bank, and Coast Capital Savings Federal Credit Union, previously a provincial cooperative credit society, as a federal credit union. In addition, orders to insure <em>in Canada</em> risks were issued to Metropolitan Tower Life Insurance Company and SCOR RE, establishing them as foreign insurance branches in Canada.</p>
      <p>Upon request, OSFI also provides advance capital confirmations on the eligibility of proposed regulatory capital instruments. A total of 20 such opinions and validations were provided in 2018-19, compared to 29 the previous year.</p>
      <p>OSFI has performance standards establishing time frames for processing applications for regulatory approval and for other services, all of which were met during the year. More information on service performance standards can be found on our website. </p>
      <h2>Legislation</h2>
      <p>In keeping with the objective of enhancing the transparency of our legislative approval process and promoting a better understanding of our interpretation of the federal financial institution statutes, OSFI develops and publishes legislative guidance, including advisories, rulings, and transaction instructions. In 2018-19, OSFI issued a revised guide to foreign bank branching and revised transaction instructions regarding purchases and redemptions of shares, and reductions of stated capital.</p>
      <p>The Government of Canada has committed to review the federal financial institution statutes every five years. OSFI actively participated in the latest review, which resulted in changes to the statutes. Some of these changes came into immediate force while others require regulations to come into force such as expanded powers regarding financial technology activities and investments, and expanded life insurers' powers to invest in infrastructure assets. </p>
      <h2>International Activities</h2>
      <p>International organizations play a key role in the development of regulatory frameworks for banks and insurers. OSFI is an active participant in a number of these groups, including the Financial Stability Board, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors.</p>
      <p>OSFI invites international regulators to the College of Supervisors held for D-SIBs and large life insurance companies. It also conducts quarterly conference calls with them to identify potential issues arising in their jurisdiction before they manifest. This collaboration assists in supervisory activities for that institution and reduces the possibility of unexpected events arising. </p>
      <h3>Financial Stability Board (FSB) </h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.fsb.org/" rel="external">FSB</a> was established in April 2009 to coordinate the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies. It develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory and other financial sector policies.</p>
      <p>Canadian representation on the FSB is shared among the Department of Finance, the Bank of Canada and OSFI. During 2018-19, OSFI's role included membership on the FSB Plenary, Steering Committee, and Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation.</p>
      <p>Some of the work during 2018-19: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>completing a processes and transparency review to maximize FSB effectiveness for the next phase of its work on promoting global financial stability</li>
        <li>publishing a report examining the effects of G20 financial regulatory reforms on the incentives to centrally clear over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives</li>
        <li>publishing a cyber lexicon -- a set of core terms related to cyber security and cyber resilience in the financial sector</li>
        <li>publishing a report assessing fintech market developments in the financial system and potential implications for financial stability</li>
        <li>launching an evaluation of the effects of reforms to end the concept of too-big-to-fail and an initiative to explore ways to address the risk of market fragmentation</li>
        <li>working with standard-setting bodies to finalize and operationalize the implementation of G20 post-crisis financial sector reforms in such areas as the insurance sector, resolution regimes and over-the-counter derivatives </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)</h3>
      <p>OSFI is an active member of the <a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/index.htm" rel="external">BCBS</a>, which provides a forum for international rule-making and cooperation on banking supervisory matters.</p>
      <p>In July 2018, OSFI issued a discussion paper outlining initial views on the scope and timing of the domestic implementation of the final Basel III reforms, issued in December 2017, in Canada. OSFI will continue to consult on the technical details of the proposed rules leading up to implementation of the operational risk framework in Q1-2021, and implementation of the credit risk, capital floor and leverage ratio elements in Q1-2022. These consultations will ensure the capital regime continues to contribute to the safety and soundness of banks in Canada while remaining consistent with our principles for regulation and supervision.</p>
      <p>In January 2019, the Governors and Heads of Supervision, the Basel Committee's oversight body, endorsed a set of revisions to the design and calibration of the market risk framework. OSFI has committed to public consultation on incorporating these revisions into its capital adequacy guidance prior to the target implementation date of the revised framework in Q1-2022. </p>
      <h3>International Accounting and Auditing Standards</h3>
      <p>As all federally regulated financial institutions in Canada are required to follow International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International Standards on Auditing (ISA), OSFI interprets and assesses international rules that may apply to Canadian financial institutions.</p>
      <p>In 2018-19, OSFI worked through the BCBS and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>contribute to the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board's finalization and approval of ISA 540 (Revised), Auditing Accounting Estimates and Related Disclosures in June 2018</li>
        <li>provide comments to the International Accounting Standards Board on its discussion paper on Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Equity in January 2019</li>
      </ul>
      <p>OSFI demonstrated its strong interest in high audit quality and engaged in work to improve audit standards and frameworks over the last year by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>contributing to the development of the Monitoring Group's White Paper on reform proposals to strengthen the governance and oversight of the international audit and ethics standard-setting boards in the public interest through membership in the BCBS </li>
        <li>overseeing high-quality audit standards through membership on the Public Interest Oversight Board</li>
        <li>completing the IFRS 9 cross-sector review and focusing on the external audit of expected credit losses to understand the application of professional skepticism to accounting estimates </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Active participation in the development of these standards and governance frameworks promotes a set of high-quality global standards and enhances our understanding of changes to accounting and auditing standards that may affect federally regulated financial institutions and OSFI's supervisory approach.</p>
      <h3>International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS)</h3>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.iaisweb.org/home" rel="external">IAIS</a> is responsible for developing and assisting in the implementation of principles, standards and other supporting material for the supervision of the insurance sector. OSFI contributes to this work through its active involvement in several committees and working groups, including the Executive Committee, Policy Development Committee (and two of its working groups), Macroprudential Committee and the Supervisory Forum.</p>
      <p>OSFI actively participates in the advancement of IAIS projects to help ensure that the outcome adequately considers the Canadian perspective. Key projects underway include the development of a holistic framework for systemic risk in the insurance sector as well as the Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (ComFrame), which also includes the creation of a global Insurance Capital Standard (ICS); and ICS Version 2.0, which is expected to be adopted in November 2019 for a five-year monitoring period, after which it would be implemented as a group-wide consolidated prescribed capital requirement.</p>
