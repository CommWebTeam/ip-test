	<p>Culture is a non-traditional risk that is difficult to quantify, qualitative in nature and unique to each financial institution. In any organization, written rules and procedures exist alongside unwritten rules, norms and expectations. These unwritten rules, which we can call an organization’s “culture”, for want of a better word, can reinforce the written rules. Or they can undermine, or at times even supplant, the written rules.</p>
	<p>An organization’s culture can influence the effectiveness of its risk management, potentially leading to excessive risk-taking and negative financial and reputational outcomes. Understanding the impact of culture on risk-taking and decision-making behaviour can help prudential regulators such as OSFI identify warning signs early and prevent or minimize events that can ultimately weaken an institution’s financial resilience or even erode public confidence.</p>

		<p>“This new initiative will further strengthen financial stability and the credit profiles of Canadian banks by focusing on how corporate culture, including human behaviour, can create excessive risks… In our view, increased scrutiny will reduce the likelihood of future improprieties.”</p>

	</div>
	<p>Recognizing that culture is a key dimension in ensuring effective supervision, OSFI created the Culture &amp; Conduct Risk Division in 2018. The team’s mandate is to provide expertise on culture and conduct risk to help identify risks facing federally regulated financial institutions as well as system-wide issues and trends.</p>
	<p>OSFI has long been diligent at advancing the work and importance of corporate governance, including its recent revisions to its Corporate Governance Guideline. A fundamental principle of the guideline is that the board of an institution is responsible for its culture.</p>
	<p>In spring 2019, OSFI began an industry culture scan as part of its research to advance its work. The industry culture scan took stock of the frameworks, communication mechanisms, software, key performance indicators/key risk indicators, and initiatives that institutions use that shape and support their culture. The scan collected inputs from a diverse sample of institutions through a questionnaire and face-to-face interviews with board members and senior managers. In November 2019, OSFI shared its observations, including the range of practices, with the participating institutions. The resulting discussion demonstrated the benefit of an open dialogue on culture within the financial services industry.</p>
	<p>Through these discussions, it became very apparent that culture clearly matters to both institutions and OSFI. One of OSFI’s findings from the industry scan is that while the board and senior management levels discuss culture-related matters, they do not always treat culture as a stand-alone topic for strategic discussion. This finding may prove insightful for institutions that face challenges in deploying effective methods and tools to promote, assess and monitor their desired culture.</p>
	<p>To gather a wide range of views on culture, OSFI’s work has included meeting with and learning from regulators in other jurisdictions about their approaches to assessing culture and conduct through a prudential lens. This helps OSFI to determine what approaches may work in the Canadian context.</p>
	<p>Ensuring we have a broad perspective is one of the reasons why OSFI created the Culture External Advisory Committee (CEAC). The CEAC consists of retired senior leaders from the financial services industry, academics and senior leaders from other industries (e.g. energy) that have a strong safety or risk management culture. The first meeting of this group took place in October and it has already begun providing practical guidance for OSFI to consider. OSFI will also bring in behavioural science experts (e.g. industrial psychologists, socio-anthropologists, etc.) to complement the existing skillsets of its supervisors. Together, these measures will help advance OSFI’s work, including building an assessment framework on culture and conduct.</p>
	<p>The references to culture in the Corporate Governance Guideline continue to be relevant and will remain as OSFI’s only explicit guidance on the topic for the foreseeable future. OSFI will continue to apply a prudential lens as it puts more focus on culture and conduct in its supervisory work.</p>
	<p>Look to future editions of <em>The OSFI Pillar</em> for updates on this work.</p>
