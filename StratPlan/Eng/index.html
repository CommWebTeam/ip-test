                    <p>I am pleased to share with you OSFI’s Strategic Plan
                        for 2019-2022.</p>
                    <p>It charts a path for our future that builds on the many
                        achievements and learnings of the past thirty years.
                        It will help focus our efforts and resources as we
                        move forward and further strengthen our ability to
                        meet our mandate.</p>
                    <p>The plan’s cornerstone is its four goals: Improve
                        regulated entities’ resilience to financial risk; improve
                        their preparedness for and resilience to non-financial
                        risks; improve our agility and operational effectiveness
                        while being responsible stewards of our resources;
                        and preserve support from Canadians and cooperation
                        from the financial services industry by being transparent
                        and accountable.</p>
                    <p>My priority for the remainder of my term is to execute this
                        plan with the support of OSFI’s employees. In this way,
                        I hope to live up to the excellence of my predecessors
                        and pass to my successor an organization that preserves
                        confidence in the Canadian financial system and its
                        oversight by being relentlessly vigilant and always
                        seeking to improve.</p>
                    <p>
                        The Canadian financial system – OSFI included – has an
                        enviable track record of stability. We will not extend that
                        record by being complacent. The future of the financial
                        services industry will be very different from the world of
                        today, and while no one knows when or how the next
                        crisis will emerge, our job is to be prepared.</p>
                    <p>
                        By remaining true to our mandate, by having the will
                        to act, and by constantly learning and improving,
                        I believe that OSFI will continue to build on its record
                        of success well into the future. This plan will guide
						us along the journey.</p>
